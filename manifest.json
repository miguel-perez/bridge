  "long_description": "Bridge is a framed moment capture system that creates experiential records with seven-dimensional analysis (embodied, attentional, affective, purposive, spatial, temporal, intersubjective) and preserves authentic first-person voice. Based on the Framed Moments framework, micro-phenomenology, experience sampling methods, and narrative therapy, Bridge helps users capture, search, and reflect on discrete moments of consciousness in ways that preserve experiential wholeness while maintaining visual specificity and narrative clarity.",
