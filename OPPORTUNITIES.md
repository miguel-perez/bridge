# Bridge Opportunities

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol) constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users
- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity
- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure
- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**
Prioritize using a barbell strategy for antifragility.
