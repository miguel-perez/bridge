# Bridge Opportunities

**Document Purpose**: This is the prioritized roadmap of features not yet implemented in Bridge. Each opportunity is scored systematically to guide development decisions. These are future possibilities, not current capabilities.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand what's coming next and contribute to high-priority features.

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol) constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users

- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity

- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure

- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**
Prioritize using a barbell strategy for antifragility.

## Pattern Recognition & Analysis Features

### HMW enable Bridge to reveal patterns through clustering similar experiences?

**Impact: 9** - Core to the vision of revealing insights neither human nor AI could see alone  
**Certainty: 7** - Clear technical approach using existing embeddings and dimensional signatures  
**Urgency: 6** - Important for delivering on Bridge's promise but basic recall works without it  
**Score: 378**

Implementation would add `{ as: "clusters" }` option to recall, grouping experiences by:

- Similar dimensional signatures
- Semantic similarity of content
- Common experiencer states

### HMW track temporal sequences to reveal natural rhythms and transitions?

**Impact: 8** - Would reveal stuck→unstuck patterns, decision flows, and personal cycles  
**Certainty: 6** - Requires temporal analysis algorithms and pattern detection  
**Urgency: 5** - Valuable but users can manually observe patterns for now  
**Score: 240**

Implementation would add `{ as: "sequence" }` option to recall, analyzing:

- Common dimensional transitions over time
- Recurring patterns in experience flows
- Natural rhythms in user's experiential landscape

### HMW capture pattern realizations as linkable experiences?

**Impact: 10** - Essential for collaborative wisdom building between human and AI  
**Certainty: 8** - Requires adding `reflects: string[]` field to SourceRecord type  
**Urgency: 7** - Currently no way to formally capture "aha" moments about patterns  
**Score: 560**

Implementation would:

- Add `reflects` field to link pattern realizations to source experiences
- Enable both human and AI to create pattern realization experiences
- Support queries like `{ filter: { reflects: "only" } }` to find all insights

### HMW support natural language temporal filters like "last week"?

**Impact: 6** - Convenience feature for more intuitive querying  
**Certainty: 9** - Straightforward date parsing and calculation  
**Urgency: 4** - Current date-based filtering works but less intuitive  
**Score: 216**

Implementation would parse strings like:

- "last week", "past month", "yesterday"
- "since Monday", "before December"
- Converting to date ranges internally

### HMW filter experiences by dimension presence/absence?

**Impact: 7** - Enables sophisticated queries about experiential qualities  
**Certainty: 8** - Clear implementation path using existing dimensional data  
**Urgency: 5** - Would unlock new query patterns but not blocking current use  
**Score: 280**

Implementation would support filters like:

- `{ embodied: { present: true }, time: { present: false } }`
- Finding experiences with specific dimensional combinations
- Excluding experiences with certain qualities

### HMW structure recall options for extensibility?

**Impact: 5** - Technical improvement for future features  
**Certainty: 9** - Clear refactoring of current parameter structure  
**Urgency: 6** - Important before adding more options  
**Score: 270**

Implementation would:

- Accept options object: `recall(query, { as, filter, limit, sort })`
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Enable future additions without breaking changes
