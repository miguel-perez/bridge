# Bridge Opportunities

**Document Purpose**: This is the prioritized roadmap of features not yet implemented in Bridge. Each opportunity is
scored systematically to guide development decisions. These are future possibilities, not current capabilities.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand what's coming next and contribute to high-priority features.

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on
systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol)
constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users

- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity

- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure

- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**
Prioritize using a barbell strategy for antifragility.
