# Bridge Opportunities

**Document Purpose**: This is the prioritized roadmap of features not yet implemented in Bridge. Each opportunity is
scored systematically to guide development decisions. These are future possibilities, not current capabilities.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand what's coming next and contribute to high-priority features.

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on
systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol)
constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users

- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity

- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure

- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**

## Barbell Strategy for Antifragility

Bridge uses a barbell strategy to balance stability with growth potential:

### **High-Certainty Foundation (Certainty 8-9)**

- Low-risk, high-certainty wins that build stable foundations
- Technical debt reduction and quality improvements
- Clear implementation paths with proven patterns

### **High-Impact Experiments (Impact 7-9, Certainty 3-6)**

- High-potential features that could transform Bridge capabilities
- Experimental approaches with significant upside
- Research and exploration of new paradigms

### **Avoid Medium-Risk Items**

- Features with moderate impact and moderate certainty
- Items that could fail without significant upside
- Fragile middle ground that doesn't contribute to antifragility

## Barbell Strategy Priority Order

Bridge prioritizes using a barbell strategy for antifragility - balancing high-certainty wins with high-impact experiments while avoiding fragile middle ground.

**Score: 378** (Impact: 9, Certainty: 6, Urgency: 7) - **COMPLETED 2025-07-24**

**Description**: Implement Bridge.flow() as a new MCP tool that orchestrates existing Bridge operations into learning loops, replacing sequential thinking with experiential problem-solving through iterative understanding evolution.

**Core Concept**: Problem-solving as spiral learning where understanding deepens through each iteration:

```
Loop 1: "Debug auth error" → [experience frustration] → [recall similar bugs] → [try permission fix]
Loop 2: "Debug auth timezone issue" → [experience insight] → [recall timezone bugs] → [check server time]
Loop 3: "Fix UTC handling" → [implement fix] → [test solution] → [document learning]
```

**Key Features**:

- **Self-defining API**: `understanding` parameter naturally guides users to articulate current grasp
- **Natural evolution**: Understanding deepens through iteration ("Fix auth" → "Fix timezone issue" → "Implement UTC fix")
- **Bridge integration**: Leverages existing tools (experience, recall, reconsider, release)
- **Transparent state**: Complete visibility into learning journey with moment tracking
- **Dynamic estimates**: Adjustable total moment expectations as understanding evolves

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
flow({
  understanding: "Current grasp of problem",
  tool: "experience|recall|reconsider|release",
  params: any[], // Array format for Bridge tools
  estimates?: number // Total moments expected
}): FlowResponse

interface FlowResponse {
  moment: string; // "3/7"
  understanding: string; // Current (echoed)
  totalMoments: number; // Running total
  lastResult?: any[]; // Tool results
  understandingHistory?: string[]; // Evolution trail
  recentMoments?: FlowMoment[]; // Context
}
```

**State Management Requirements**:

- Persistent flow state across multiple MCP calls
- Understanding evolution tracking (simple string history)
- Moment history with loop attribution
- Integration with existing Bridge storage

**Benefits**:

- **Transformative UX**: Replaces sequential thinking with experiential learning
- **Natural problem-solving**: Models how humans actually solve problems
- **Bridge enhancement**: Adds orchestration layer to existing tools
- **Transparent learning**: Complete visibility into understanding evolution
- **Self-guiding**: API naturally encourages articulation of current understanding

**Implementation Challenges**:

- State persistence across MCP tool calls
- Simple understanding evolution tracking (no complex revision/branching)
- Integration with existing Bridge tool structure
- Moment history management and cleanup
- Flow completion detection and cleanup

**Success Criteria**:

- Users can start flows with initial understanding
- Understanding evolves naturally through tool usage (no complex revision logic)
- Complete state visibility in responses
- Seamless integration with existing Bridge tools
- Flow state persists across conversation turns

**MCP Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing Bridge tool structure, adds orchestration layer without breaking changes.

**Priority Rationale**: High impact (transforms problem-solving approach), medium certainty (clear concept with simple state management), medium urgency (significant UX enhancement but not blocking).

**Key Insight**: Bridge.flow() focuses on orchestration, not duplication. It leverages existing Bridge tools:

- **reconsider** handles revisions (no need for complex revision logic)
- **recall** handles branching exploration (no need for branching state)
- **experience** captures insights (no need for complex thought tracking)
- **release** handles cleanup (no need for complex state management)
