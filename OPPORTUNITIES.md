# Bridge Opportunities

**Document Purpose**: This is the prioritized roadmap of features not yet implemented in Bridge. Each opportunity is
scored systematically to guide development decisions. These are future possibilities, not current capabilities.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand what's coming next and contribute to high-priority features.

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on
systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol)
constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users

- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity

- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure

- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**
Prioritize using a barbell strategy for antifragility.

## Pattern Recognition & Analysis Features

### HMW enable Bridge to reveal patterns through clustering similar experiences?

**Impact: 9** - Core to the vision of revealing insights neither human nor AI could see alone  
**Certainty: 7** - Clear technical approach using existing embeddings and dimensional signatures  
**Urgency: 6** - Important for delivering on Bridge's promise but basic recall works without it  
**Score: 378**

Implementation would add `{ as: "clusters" }` option to recall, grouping experiences by:

- Similar dimensional signatures
- Semantic similarity of content
- Common experiencer states

### HMW track temporal sequences to reveal natural rhythms and transitions?

**Impact: 8** - Would reveal stuck→unstuck patterns, decision flows, and personal cycles  
**Certainty: 6** - Requires temporal analysis algorithms and pattern detection  
**Urgency: 5** - Valuable but users can manually observe patterns for now  
**Score: 240**

Implementation would add `{ as: "sequence" }` option to recall, analyzing:

- Common dimensional transitions over time
- Recurring patterns in experience flows
- Natural rhythms in user's experiential landscape

### ✓ COMPLETED: Pattern realizations with reflects field

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21 (See EXP-005 in EXPERIMENTS.md)

This opportunity has been successfully implemented with:
- Added `reflects?: string[]` field to Source interface and Zod schemas
- Implemented `reflects: 'only'` filter to find pattern realizations
- Added `reflected_by` filter for reverse lookups
- Enhanced tool descriptions with natural language patterns
- Updated test data generation to include pattern realizations

The pattern realizations feature now enables:
- Both human and AI to capture "aha" moments about connections between experiences
- Bidirectional linking between experiences and insights
- Sophisticated queries for discovering pattern insights
- Foundation for collaborative wisdom building

See `src/core/types.ts` and `src/services/unified-scoring.ts` for implementation.

### HMW support natural language temporal filters like "last week"?

**Impact: 6** - Convenience feature for more intuitive querying  
**Certainty: 9** - Straightforward date parsing and calculation  
**Urgency: 4** - Current date-based filtering works but less intuitive  
**Score: 216**

Implementation would parse strings like:

- "last week", "past month", "yesterday"
- "since Monday", "before December"
- Converting to date ranges internally

### HMW filter experiences by dimension presence/absence?

**Impact: 7** - Enables sophisticated queries about experiential qualities  
**Certainty: 8** - Clear implementation path using existing dimensional data  
**Urgency: 5** - Would unlock new query patterns but not blocking current use  
**Score: 280**

Implementation would support filters like:

- `{ embodied: { present: true }, time: { present: false } }`
- Finding experiences with specific dimensional combinations
- Excluding experiences with certain qualities

### HMW structure recall options for extensibility?

**Impact: 5** - Technical improvement for future features  
**Certainty: 9** - Clear refactoring of current parameter structure  
**Urgency: 6** - Important before adding more options  
**Score: 270**

Implementation would:

- Accept options object: `recall(query, { as, filter, limit, sort })`
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Enable future additions without breaking changes

## Development Process Improvements

### ✓ COMPLETED: Intelligent learning loop that provides actionable recommendations

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21 (See EXP-003 in EXPERIMENTS.md)

This opportunity has been successfully implemented with:
- Smart test execution (only runs when code changes)
- Context aggregation from git, tests, and documentation
- Prioritized recommendations with evidence trails
- Enhanced experiment detection by content matching
- Markdown report generation

The learning loop now automatically:
- Detects completed experiments
- Identifies development patterns (e.g., high bug fix rates)
- Suggests documentation updates
- Tracks test coverage trends

See `src/scripts/learning-loop.ts` for implementation.

### ✓ COMPLETED: Strategic test coverage improvement

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21 (See EXP-004 in EXPERIMENTS.md)

This opportunity has been successfully implemented with:

- Test coverage improved from 27% to 82% (exceeding 60% target)
- 100% coverage on all critical handler files
- Comprehensive edge case and error path testing
- 3,593 lines of test code added across 13 files

The high test coverage now provides:

- Reduced bug introduction rate
- Confidence in refactoring
- Clear examples of component usage
- Protection against regressions

See LEARNINGS.md for insights and patterns discovered.

### HMW maintain code quality through continuous monitoring?

**Impact: 7** - Prevents regression and maintains the high quality achieved  
**Certainty: 8** - Clear metrics and thresholds based on current state  
**Urgency: 6** - Important to lock in the gains from test coverage improvement  
**Score: 336**

Implementation would:

- Set minimum coverage thresholds (80% line, 65% branch)
- Add pre-commit hooks for coverage checks
- Track bug fix rate trends over time
- Alert when quality metrics decline
- Integrate with learning loop for proactive recommendations
