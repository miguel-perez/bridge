# Bridge Opportunities

This document comprehensively lists all potential features and improvements for Bridge, organized by priority based on systematic scoring. All opportunities have been evaluated for compatibility with MCP (Model Context Protocol) constraints.

## Scoring Methodology

Each opportunity is scored on three dimensions:

### Impact (1-10): Value delivered to users
- **9-10**: Transformative - fundamentally changes Bridge capabilities
- **7-8**: Major enhancement - significantly improves experience
- **5-6**: Moderate improvement - useful but not game-changing
- **3-4**: Minor enhancement - nice to have
- **1-2**: Minimal value

### Certainty (1-10): Implementation clarity
- **9-10**: Crystal clear - we know exactly how to build
- **7-8**: Well understood - clear path with minor unknowns
- **5-6**: Moderate clarity - approach known but details fuzzy
- **3-4**: Significant unknowns - research needed
- **1-2**: Highly experimental

### Urgency (1-10): Timing pressure
- **9-10**: Critical blocker - preventing core functionality
- **7-8**: High priority - actively limiting experience
- **5-6**: Medium priority - important but not blocking
- **3-4**: Low priority - would be nice eventually
- **1-2**: Future consideration

**Score = Impact × Certainty × Urgency**

3. **Basic export** - Simple JSON dump of user's memories
4. **Clustering exposure** - Minimal wrapper around existing code
5. **Formation feedback** - Add reasoning to experience responses

## Research Questions

These need investigation before implementation:

1. What constitutes "meaningful" content for activation thresholds?
2. How to handle contradictory memories from different perspectives?
3. What's the best UI for memory correction workflows?
4. How to preserve privacy while enabling pattern sharing?
5. Can we detect false or manipulated memories?

## MCP Architecture Constraints

All opportunities respect these MCP realities:
- **Tools are explicitly visible** - No "seamless" or "invisible" integration
- **Request/response pattern** - No real-time streaming or continuous updates  
- **Data-only returns** - Tools return data, not UI elements
- **AI-controlled activation** - The AI decides when to use tools, not Bridge
- **Stateless protocol** - Persistence handled by Bridge's storage layer
