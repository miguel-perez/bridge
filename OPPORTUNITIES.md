# Bridge Opportunity Backlog

## How to Generate Opportunities from VISION.md

1. **Read a section** of VISION.md (e.g., understand() operation)
2. **Ask questions** about assumptions, risks, and unknowns:
   - "Will users actually...?"
   - "Does this work when...?"
   - "How do we know if...?"
   - "What happens when...?"
3. **Frame as testable questions** (not statements or tasks)
4. **Break down** complex questions into sub-questions using `→`

## How to Score Opportunities

### Impact (1-10): Would the answer change our approach?
- 10 = Would completely reshape the product
- 7-9 = Would significantly alter a major feature
- 4-6 = Would refine implementation details
- 1-3 = Nice to know but won't change much

### Certainty (1-10): How likely are we to get a useful answer?
- 10 = Guaranteed to learn (e.g., user observation)
- 7-9 = Very likely to learn (e.g., prototype testing)
- 4-6 = Might learn something (e.g., new method)
- 1-3 = Moonshot - might learn nothing OR everything

### Urgency (1-10): When does this opportunity expire?
- 10 = Days (e.g., user available now, decision needed)
- 7-9 = Weeks (e.g., before next milestone)
- 4-6 = Months (e.g., before major launch)
- 1-3 = Years or never expires

## The 80/20 Prioritization Approach

1. **Sort by Score** (Impact × Certainty × Urgency)
2. **Look for natural breaks** in scores (e.g., 400+, 200-400, <200)
3. **Focus on top 20%** of opportunities that will likely generate 80% of learnings
4. **Balance the portfolio**:
   - Mix high-certainty validation with low-certainty exploration
   - Include both urgent fixes and long-term bets
   - Have 3-5 items "In Progress" maximum

## New Questions from Test Insights

### Silent Tool Operation (Impact: 9, Certainty: 8, Urgency: 7) = 504
**Question**: Can Bridge tools operate completely silently without any user-visible announcements?
- Sub-question → How do we maintain transparency without disrupting flow?
- Sub-question → What's the minimum feedback needed for user trust?
- Sub-question → Can tool results be woven into natural responses?

### Delayed Tool Activation (Impact: 8, Certainty: 7, Urgency: 6) = 336
**Question**: Should Bridge wait for emotional connection before activating memory tools?
- Sub-question → What signals indicate readiness for tool usage?
- Sub-question → How many turns of natural conversation are optimal?
- Sub-question → Does delayed activation improve overall experience quality?

### Physical State Integration (Impact: 7, Certainty: 9, Urgency: 5) = 315
**Question**: How can Bridge naturally incorporate physical/emotional state markers?
- Sub-question → Do state markers enhance memory recall effectiveness?
- Sub-question → Can AI generate appropriate state markers autonomously?
- Sub-question → What's the impact on experiential wholeness?
