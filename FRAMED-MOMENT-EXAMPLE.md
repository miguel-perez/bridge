## Core Moment

**First-Person Voice**:

```
Those car conversations were so great - Sal had been giving me rides ever since we discovered he lived just two blocks away. 34 minutes from Trevose back to North Philly, beats the hour and 48 minutes by bus and train. He's this talented designer, mid-twenties, maybe 5'6" to my 6'2", wore hoodies. We're stopped at an intersection and he turned to me and said:

"You should be a designer."

"What do you mean?"

"You think like a designer."

I remember looking down when he said that, at my hands, then out at those row homes. Part of why I'd gone to learn how to code because I thought art wasn't secure enough. That's the first time someone ever gave me such clear career advice - everything shifted.

We were both kids from "the badlands" who made it to the tech scene. My dad was doing 3-hour commutes as a baker, making what I was making at 18. When you come from that, art feels like luxury. Sal wasn't just identifying a skill. He was giving permission.

From one North Philly kid to another - permission to be more than practical.

_From Recording 10/27/23 - Sides Creative Experience_

> At the time I was exploring, well, what could it look like for me to freelance, go back to freelancing, but instead be doing more web design stuff. And I think I, at, at that time when working with Sal Had a conversation with him, I realized that he lived like two blocks away from me. And so he started, uh, giving me rides to work so I didn't have to go on the, on the bus for an hour, which was awesome. And those car conversations were so great, and we would talk about all sorts of things and a lot of design-related topics. And he like turned around to me and said like, you should be a designer. And I'm like, what do you mean? It's like, you think like a designer, you should be a designer. And, and I guess like that's like the first time someone's ever been like giving me like, I don't know, such clear career advice because I had wanted to learn how to do more software development so that I could, uh, make money, make more money more, more in a more sustainable fashion. Uh, well, here is, uh, a guy who's teaching me web development, but then looking at me being like, Hey, you should, you should consider design 'cause you think like a designer. And that was interesting to me.

### Evolution Through Dialog

- "I'm hispanic, and Sal is Asian, he was in his late 20's at the time."
- "One thing, I'm / was pretty tall at 6'2 and Sal was pretty short, maybe 5'6"
- "I have curly hair and brown skin"
- "We're young guys in philly, creative tech types, 2010's"
- "I remember looking down when he said that, thinking deeply, realizing, I'd gone to learn how to write code because I thought art was not secure enough"
- "I was looking toward traffic or the window"
- "it was NE philly. We lived in North Philly, more toward Hunting Park"
- "Sides Media was in Trevose, about a 34 minute drive away"
- "Beats the 1hr and 48min bus and train ride I was taking"
- "I think the cool thing about Sal's advice is that he is a very talented designer with a lot great projects under his belt even back then"
- "He always wore hoodies"
- "the detail i remember most were the row homes as we stopped at an intersection when he glanced at me"
- "Sal and I were both north philly kids of color. The philly tech scene at the time, well, not so much. I don't know. just meant a lot that we both came from the hood, north philly is nicknamed "the badlands" lol. Though we lived in Juniata park.. it was a little bit more north and closer to NE, things got a little nicer. Lots of lower-income families just starting to break into the middle class. My dad was was a Baker, he traveled on bus and train for 3 hours each way, and made as much as I was making then."

### Key Figures

- **Miguel**: 18-19 years old, Hispanic with curly hair and brown skin, 6'2", from North Philly (Juniata Park area)
- **Sal (Kosal Sen)**: Late 20s, Asian, 5'6", accomplished designer with great projects, first design mentor, always wore hoodies, also from North Philly

### Setting Context

- Young Philly creative tech scene, 2010s
- Casual agency culture, not corporate
- Two kids of color from North Philly in a predominantly white tech scene
- Both from "the badlands" - though Miguel's family lived in Juniata Park (bit north, closer to NE)
- Context of lower-income families just breaking into middle class
- What Miguel wore: Not remembered
- What Sal wore: His usual hoodie

### Family Context

- Miguel's father: Baker who commuted 3 hours each way (bus and train)
- Father's salary: Same as Miguel was making in tech at 18-19
- Family just breaking into middle class from lower-income
- This context explains the pressure to choose "practical" over artistic

## Seven Dimensional Analysis

### 1. Embodied Presence

**Prominence**: 0.8  
**Manifestation**: The physical constraints of the car amplify the moment - my tall frame folded into the passenger seat, knees bent up, creating this intimate enclosed space. Looking down at my hands, then out at the row homes as the words sink in. The car stopped at an intersection, creating stillness for this exchange. The height difference creating an unexpected dynamic where wisdom literally flows upward. The specific visual anchor of Philadelphia row homes grounding the moment in place.

### 2. Attentional Flow

**Prominence**: 0.9  
**Manifestation**: Attention moves in waves - from casual design conversation to sharp focus on Sal's words, then immediately inward. The external world (traffic, streets) becomes a backdrop for internal processing. That specific moment when "you think like a designer" lands and everything else blurs except this recognition of a truth I'd been avoiding.

### 3. Affective Atmosphere

**Prominence**: 0.8  
**Manifestation**: Surprise mixing with a deep sense of being seen. The stillness of being stopped at an intersection creating space for unexpected validation. Under the surprise, a current of relief - someone else sees what I've been afraid to claim. The comfortable casualness of the moment - Sal in his usual hoodie, just another commute, stopped at a typical Philly intersection with row homes as witness - suddenly charged with the weight of life direction. Two kids from North Philly who made it to tech, one telling the other it's okay to be more than just practical. The recognition landing harder because it comes from someone who understands both worlds.

### 4. Purposive Momentum

**Prominence**: 0.9  
**Manifestation**: The moment captures a pivot - I came to Sides to learn "practical" web development, convinced that my pixel art background wasn't enough. Coming from North Philly, from a family just breaking into middle class, "practical" meant survival - not luxury. Art felt risky when your dad commutes 3 hours to make baker's wages. Sal's recognition collides with my security-seeking trajectory. In this moment, the purposive energy shifts from running away from art toward potentially embracing design. Someone who understood the weight of that choice was telling me it was okay to choose passion.

### 5. Spatial Situation

**Prominence**: 0.6  
**Manifestation**: The confined space of a car stopped at an intersection in Northeast Philadelphia, somewhere between Trevose and North Philly. Not a formal office or planned meeting, but the transitional space of a commute where guards are down - made even more intimate by being temporarily stationary. This 34-minute drive - which saves me over an hour compared to public transit - has become a regular gift of time and mentorship. The spatial mismatch (tall passenger, shorter driver) creating an intimate bubble where conventional hierarchies don't apply. Row homes as witnesses to this pivotal moment.

### 6. Temporal Flow

**Prominence**: 0.8  
**Manifestation**: Time crystallizes - there's the flow of all our previous car conversations leading to this, the immediate present of his words landing while stopped at this intersection, and the future suddenly opening differently. The moment contains my past (pixel artist who chose "security"), present (web developer questioning that choice), and future (designer possibilities). I can picture it clearly - the row homes, Sal in his hoodie, my hands in my lap - even if I can't remember exactly what I was wearing.

### 7. Intersubjective Field

**Prominence**: 1.0  
**Manifestation**: This moment is fundamentally about being seen. Sal as accomplished designer, mentor, daily companion recognizing something I hadn't claimed. But deeper - Sal as another North Philly kid who made it, who understood why I chose "practical" over passion. Two kids of color in a predominantly white tech scene, finding each other. The recognition carries extra weight because it comes from someone who knows the full journey - from the badlands to the tech world. This isn't empty encouragement but understanding from someone who's walked the same path. The generous act of recognition made more powerful by shared origins. In giving me rides, he was literally and metaphorically making sure I didn't have to travel as far as our parents had to.

## What This Moment Teaches

1. **Recognition from credible sources hits different** - especially when they share your journey
2. **We run from our gifts** thinking we need something more "secure" - and that pressure is different when you've seen real insecurity
3. **Shared origins deepen understanding** - two North Philly kids in tech recognized something in each other
4. **Recognition often comes sideways** - at intersections, in casual conversation, from unexpected sources
5. **Generosity creates space for truth** - Sal saving me over an hour each day, making sure I didn't have to travel as far as our parents
6. **Physical details matter** - the height difference, the looking away, the row homes all carry meaning
7. **Mentorship can happen between peers** - Sal was only in his late 20s, already accomplished but not a senior authority
8. **Simple words can redirect lives** - "You think like a designer" became permission to choose passion over just survival
9. **Real memory anchors differ from assumed details** - row homes at intersection, not imagined golden light

## Connection to Larger Patterns

This moment connects to Miguel's recurring pattern of "constraint as creative force" - just as pixel art's limitations led to innovation, the confined car space created intimacy for truth. It also exemplifies how Miguel's journey repeatedly involves others seeing his design talents before he fully claims them himself.

The shared North Philly background adds another layer - the pattern of first-generation tech workers navigating between worlds, carrying the weight of families just breaking into middle class, choosing between survival and passion. Sal's recognition gave permission to choose passion without abandoning practicality.

The moment stands as a threshold - before this, pursuing code for security; after, beginning to accept design as identity. It's a FramedMoment that changed the frame of a life, made possible by someone who understood the full weight of that choice.
