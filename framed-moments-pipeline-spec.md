# The Seven Experiential Qualities: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Every moment of conscious experience contains multiple dimensions that arise together as a unified field. While we can distinguish these qualities analytically, in lived experience they interpenetrate and mutually constitute each other. This guide explores each quality in depth, providing examples to illustrate how they manifest in different moments.

---

## 1. Embodied Presence

### Definition
How physicality textures the moment - the felt sense of being a body in space, including sensations, postures, gestures, and the visceral dimension of experience.

### Key Aspects
- Physical sensations (temperature, texture, pressure, pain, pleasure)
- Bodily positioning and posture
- Gestures and movements
- Visceral responses (gut feelings, heart rate, breathing)
- The sense of physical scale and proportion
- Embodied metaphors (feeling "heavy," "light," "expanded," "contracted")

### Examples

**High Prominence (0.9)**
```
My fingers fumble with the tiny clasp, made clumsy by the cold. I can feel 
my grandmother's eyes on me as I struggle with her necklace, my hands too 
big and rough for this delicate work. The metal bites into my fingertips. 
My shoulders hunch forward, creating a cave of concentration. When the clasp 
finally clicks, my whole body exhales - I didn't know I was holding my breath.
```

**Moderate Prominence (0.5)**
```
I scan the conference room, noting the exits, the windows, counting heads. 
My body stays loose, ready - an old habit from my security days. Even in 
this corporate setting, I sit where I can see the door.
```

**Subtle Presence (0.2)**
```
The equation finally makes sense. I stare at the whiteboard, barely aware 
of the marker still in my hand, the slight ache in my lower back from 
standing here for an hour.
```

---

## 2. Attentional Flow

### Definition
The direction, quality, and movement of awareness - how consciousness focuses, disperses, shifts, or sustains itself within the moment.

### Key Aspects
- Focal point (narrow vs. diffuse attention)
- Quality of attention (sharp, soft, vigilant, relaxed)
- Movement patterns (darting, sustained, circular, expanding/contracting)
- Foreground/background dynamics
- Shifts and transitions in awareness
- Meta-attention (awareness of where attention goes)

### Examples

**Sharp, Focused Attention (0.9)**
```
Everything narrows to the tip of my soldering iron and that microscopic 
connection point. The world beyond these few millimeters ceases to exist. 
My breathing slows, syncs with my heartbeat. One wrong twitch and three 
hours of work evaporates. The universe contracts to this single point of 
molten silver.
```

**Distributed, Field Attention (0.8)**
```
I stand in my gallery opening, awareness spread like a net across the room. 
I track the critic by the window (is she frowning?), catch my partner's 
supportive nod from the bar, notice someone lingering by my most experimental 
piece. Each conversation I'm in contains echoes of all the others. My attention 
is everywhere and nowhere, a kind of hovering presence over my own event.
```

**Wandering Attention (0.6)**
```
The meditation bell rings but my mind is already three thoughts downstream - 
from my breath to my grocery list to that weird email from Marcus. I catch 
myself, return to breathing, but within seconds I'm planning tomorrow's 
presentation. Each return to the breath feels like wading upstream against 
my own mental current.
```

---

## 3. Affective Atmosphere

### Definition
The emotional coloring or feeling tone that pervades experience - not just specific emotions but the overall mood-space within which the moment unfolds.

### Key Aspects
- Specific emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear)
- Background feeling tones (ease, tension, openness, constriction)
- Emotional complexity (mixed feelings, ambivalence)
- Intensity and saturation
- Emotional movement (building, releasing, shifting)
- The space between named emotions

### Examples

**Intense, Clear Emotion (0.9)**
```
Pure joy floods through me as her tiny fingers wrap around mine for the 
first time. My daughter, here, real, breathing. The NICU fades away - 
the beeping machines, the worried weeks, all of it dissolves in this 
moment of her perfect grip. I'm crying and laughing and my chest might 
actually burst from this feeling that has no ceiling, no edges.
```

**Complex, Mixed Atmosphere (0.8)**
```
Standing in my childhood home, now empty for the estate sale, I feel like 
I'm breathing memories. Each room holds its own emotional weather - the 
kitchen still warm with phantom dinners, the basement still carrying that 
particular cocktail of fear and adventure from childhood games. I'm grieving 
and grateful, relieved and resistant. The feelings layer like sediment, 
impossible to separate.
```

**Subtle Atmospheric Shift (0.4)**
```
Something changes in the room when she mentions his name. The dinner 
conversation continues but there's a new tightness, like the air pressure 
dropped. I watch mom's smile become more effortful, dad's jokes land 
a little too hard. We're all pretending nothing shifted, which makes 
the shift even more palpable.
```

---

## 4. Purposive Momentum

### Definition
The directedness or drift of experience - the sense of moving toward, away from, or through something. The intentional arc or aimless flow that carries the moment.

### Key Aspects
- Clear goals vs. open exploration
- Urgency and temporal pressure
- The pull of purpose or push of avoidance
- Conflicting directions
- Momentum building or dissipating
- The difference between driven and drawn

### Examples

**Strong, Clear Direction (0.9)**
```
Every fiber of my being points toward that finish line. Six months of 
training crystallize into this singular purpose. My divorce papers, the 
job loss, the therapy sessions - all of it fuels each stride. This isn't 
just a marathon; it's my proof that I can finish something that matters. 
My body is just the vehicle for this deeper crossing.
```

**Conflicted Purpose (0.7)**
```
I sit in the parking lot, engine running, caught between two futures. 
Inside that building is the intervention that might save my brother or 
destroy our relationship forever. My hand hovers over the gear shift - 
forward into necessary betrayal, reverse into enabling comfort. The 
car idles like my indecision, burning fuel, going nowhere.
```

**Purposeless Drift (0.8)**
```
Sunday afternoon spreads before me like spilled honey. I move from 
couch to kitchen to window, not searching for anything, just moving 
through the apartment like a slow current. This isn't procrastination - 
there's nothing to procrastinate from. It's the rare luxury of a day 
without arrows, without destinations. I follow only the gentle pull 
of whim and comfort.
```

---

## 5. Spatial Situation

### Definition
The lived sense of place and position - not just physical location but how space is experienced, inhabited, and meaningful within the moment.

### Key Aspects
- Physical location and environment
- Sense of scale (intimate/vast, enclosed/exposed)
- Relationship to boundaries and thresholds
- Feeling positioned (centered, peripheral, liminal)
- Sacred or charged spaces
- The body's negotiation with space

### Examples

**Charged Spatial Presence (0.8)**
```
I enter my father's study for the first time since he died. The room 
resists me - not physically, but something about crossing this threshold 
feels like breaking a spell. His reading chair creates its own gravity 
well, papers on the desk still arranged in his particular chaos. I'm 
an intruder here, even though it's my house now. The space holds his 
shape like an invisible mold.
```

**Liminal Space (0.7)**
```
Airport gate 47B at 3 AM. I exist in the nowhere between places, surrounded 
by other travelers suspended like me between departure and arrival. The 
fluorescent lights create a perpetual noon, making time as placeless as 
we are. My body doesn't know which timezone to believe. I'm not in Chicago 
anymore but not yet in London - I'm in the gray space where journeys hover.
```

**Intimate Enclosure (0.6)**
```
We've transformed the hospital room into our own small world. Fairy lights 
soften the medical glare, her favorite quilt covers the industrial bed. 
In this tiny space, death feels both closer and somehow held at bay by 
our careful domestication. We've made a home inside the unhomelike, a 
nest in the sterile branches of modern medicine.
```

---

## 6. Temporal Flow

### Definition
How past and future inhabit the present moment - the experience of time's movement, memory's presence, anticipation's pull, and the thickness or thinness of now.

### Key Aspects
- Time's pace (racing, crawling, suspended)
- Memory's intrusion or gentle presence
- Future pulling or pressing into now
- The density of the present moment
- Cyclical vs. linear time experience
- Temporal echoes and rhymes

### Examples

**Time Dilation (0.9)**
```
The car spins through its third rotation and time becomes taffy. I watch 
my coffee cup float past in discrete frames, each second stretched to 
contain whole thoughts: "So this is how it ends. I should have called mom. 
The airbag hasn't deployed yet. Is that my phone or Sarah's sliding across 
the dash?" When we finally stop, craterd against the median, only four 
seconds have passed. I lived a small lifetime in those seconds.
```

**Past and Present Overlapping (0.8)**
```
Teaching my daughter to ride a bike in the same park where dad taught me. 
Time folds like origami - I'm simultaneously the nervous child feeling his 
steady hand on the seat and the nervous parent trying to project that same 
confidence. "You've got this, sweetheart," I say, hearing his voice inside 
mine, feeling his ghost hands guiding my guiding hands. Twenty-five years 
collapse into this single wobbling moment.
```

**Future Pressing into Present (0.7)**
```
The acceptance letter sits unopened on my kitchen table, radiating possibility. 
In this moment before knowing, I'm simultaneously accepted and rejected, 
moving to Scotland and staying home, becoming a new person and remaining 
myself. The future branches in front of me like lightning, and all paths 
remain real until I break that seal. My hand hovers, prolonging this 
moment of infinite potential.
```

---

## 7. Intersubjective Field

### Definition
How others' presence or absence shapes the moment - the social dimension of experience, including felt presences, relational dynamics, and the internalized voices that populate consciousness.

### Key Aspects
- Physical presence of others
- Felt absence of significant others
- Internalized voices and imagined audiences
- Relational dynamics and power flows
- Collective atmosphere and group mind
- The social construction of meaning

### Examples

**Intense Relational Presence (1.0)**
```
She sees me. Really sees me. In this crowded conference room, while I 
stumble through my presentation about sustainable design, her eyes hold 
something I've never encountered - not just attention but recognition. 
It's like she can see past my nervousness to the vision I'm failing to 
articulate. When I finish, her single nod carries more validation than 
any applause. I don't know her name yet, but somehow she knows mine - 
the one I haven't even spoken aloud.
```

**Absence as Presence (0.8)**
```
I set the table for four out of habit, then stare at dad's empty chair. 
Six months gone and my hands still reach for four plates. The conversation 
flows around his absence like water around a stone - we talk louder, laugh 
harder, working to fill the space his quiet presence used to hold. His 
undrunk coffee cup becomes a shrine to the shape of missing.
```

**Internalized Audience (0.6)**
```
Writing the resignation letter, I hear them all: Mom's disappointed sigh, 
Marcus asking if I've really thought this through, my business school 
professors shaking their heads. Each word I type has to push through 
their imagined objections. But underneath their chorus, a quieter voice - 
maybe mine, maybe who I'm becoming - whispers "finally." I write toward 
that whisper, away from their noise.
```

---

## Integration and Interplay

These qualities never exist in isolation. They arise together, shape each other, and create the unified field of experience. A moment of recognition (intersubjective) might trigger a physical response (embodied) that shifts our emotional atmosphere (affective) and redirects our purpose (purposive). 

The art of capturing framed moments lies not in cataloging every dimension but in recognizing which qualities are most alive and allowing them to reveal the whole through their particular prominence.

### Example of Integration

```
The boxing gym at 5 AM (spatial) hammers with preparation. My body knows 
this ritual - hands wrapping themselves while my mind sharpens to a point 
(embodied, attentional). Coach Teresa watches from the corner, and I can 
feel her assessment like weight on my shoulders (intersubjective). Six 
weeks until the championship (temporal), every movement now carries that 
future (purposive). The familiar cocktail of fear and hunger rises 
(affective), but this morning it tastes different - cleaner somehow, 
more mine. I step into the ring and become what I've been becoming.
```

In this moment, all seven qualities are present and interpenetrating:
- Embodied: hands wrapping, mind sharpening
- Attentional: focused preparation
- Affective: fear and hunger, but "cleaner"
- Purposive: six weeks to championship
- Spatial: the specific gym at specific time
- Temporal: future pressing into present practice
- Intersubjective: coach's presence and assessment

The moment is one thing experienced through multiple facets, each revealing and constituting the others.

## Chunking Strategy: From Flow to Frames

### The Fundamental Tension

The framework acknowledges a core paradox: consciousness flows continuously (as philosophers like Bergson argued), yet human communication and understanding require discrete units. Rather than deny this tension, the framework works creatively within it, building on Event Segmentation Theory's finding that people naturally parse experience into meaningful chunks at moments of change, surprise, or goal transitions. 

What's remarkable is that the seven experiential qualities themselves naturally embody these segmentation principles - they are the experiential face of the same cognitive patterns EST describes scientifically.

### Primary Chunking Principle: Experiential Frames

The central chunking strategy uses **"framing"** as an intuitive guide - but this goes beyond just visual anchoring. An experiential frame is what consciousness naturally holds as a unit, whether anchored by:

- **Attentional boundaries** (where focus shifts or sharpens) 
- **Purposive boundaries** (goal initiation, completion, redirection)
- **Affective boundaries** (emotional shifts or crystallizations)
- **Temporal boundaries** (pace changes, duration becoming significant)
- **Spatial boundaries** (crossing thresholds, entering/leaving)
- **Social boundaries** (others arriving, leaving, or changing dynamics)

Think of it like how memory naturally packages experience - some memories are visual scenes, others are emotional atmospheres, still others are purposive arcs. The "frame" is whatever creates coherent boundaries for that particular moment.

### Natural Segmentation Points: How Qualities Signal Boundaries

The seven experiential qualities themselves indicate natural breakpoints - aligning with Event Segmentation Theory's findings about when we naturally chunk experience:

#### 1. **Attentional Flow Shifts** (EST: Prediction Error)
- Surprise or recognition moments ("it clicks")
- Focus suddenly narrowing or expanding
- Meta-cognitive moments (noticing your own thinking)
- Disrupted expectations requiring attention redirect

#### 2. **Purposive Momentum Changes** (EST: Goal Boundaries)
- Goal completion or achievement
- Goal failure or abandonment  
- Purpose conflicts emerging
- New intentions crystallizing
- Subgoal transitions within larger activities

#### 3. **Spatial Situation Transitions** (EST: Spatial Boundaries)
- Crossing thresholds (doorways, boundaries)
- Entering/leaving defined spaces
- Spatial scale shifts (intimate to vast)
- Movement between regions or zones

#### 4. **Temporal Flow Shifts** (EST: Hierarchical Grain Size)
- Pace changes (time speeding/slowing)
- Memory intrusions changing the present
- Future suddenly pressing in
- Duration itself becoming significant
- Shifts between event grain sizes

#### 5. **Intersubjective Field Changes** (EST: Actor/Social Boundaries)
- Others entering or leaving
- Attention shifting between people
- Social dynamics transforming
- Felt presences emerging or receding

#### 6. **Affective Atmosphere Transitions**
- Emotional shifts or intensifications
- Mixed feelings crystallizing
- Mood transformations
- Atmosphere changes in space or group

#### 7. **Embodied Presence Changes** (EST: Movement/Object Boundaries)
- Starting/stopping physical actions
- Contact with objects (grasp, release)
- Posture or position shifts
- Visceral responses emerging

### The Hierarchy Emerges from Quality Prominence

The natural hierarchy that EST describes emerges from how many qualities shift and how dramatically:

- **Fine-grained segments**: Single quality shows minor variation (0.1-0.3 shift)
- **Basic-level events**: One or two qualities transform significantly (0.5+ shift)  
- **Coarse-grained boundaries**: Multiple qualities shift together (major transition)

This explains why we sometimes chunk at subtle moments (just attention shifting) and sometimes only at major transitions (everything changes at once). The cognitive load of tracking all seven qualities means we naturally segment when the experiential field reorganizes itself.

### Flexible Temporal Scales

Rather than fixed duration, the framework accommodates different temporal chunks:

**Instant Moments** (seconds)
```
The glass slips. Time dilates. I watch it fall, knowing I can't catch it, 
already hearing the crash that hasn't happened yet.
```

**Brief Moments** (seconds to minutes)
```
I reach for the door handle, my fingers tremble with that particular
cocktail of hope and dread that comes with final interviews.
```

**Durational Moments** (minutes to hours)
```
I sit beside her hospital bed for twenty minutes now, maybe more. My
attention goes soft, unfocused, except for the rhythm of her breath.
```

**Extended Moments** (when duration itself is the experience)
```
The third hour of meditation. I've passed through restlessness, boredom,
and frustration into something else - a spacious nowhere that includes
everything.
```

### Chunking Guidelines

1. **Let experience lead**: Chunk where experience naturally presents itself as graspable
2. **Trust perceptual intuition**: If you can "see" it as a moment, it likely is one
3. **Preserve wholeness**: Better to include too much than break experiential unity
4. **Accept irregularity**: Some moments are brief, others extended - duration varies
5. **Honor transitions**: Often the richest moments happen at boundaries
6. **Include the ineffable**: Don't exclude moments just because they're hard to capture

### What NOT to Do

- Don't chunk by word count or arbitrary time units
- Don't break unified experiences into artificial segments
- Don't exclude "messy" moments that resist clean boundaries
- Don't force all moments into the same temporal scale
- Don't prioritize "significant" moments over mundane ones

### Validation Questions

When deciding if you've chunked appropriately, ask:

- Can I hold this as a unified experience in attention/memory?
- Does it feel experientially complete?
- Which qualities shifted to create this boundary?
- Would breaking it smaller lose essential unity?
- Does combining it with adjacent experience blur distinct felt-senses?
- Does it naturally imply what came before/after?

Remember: We chunk not because experience comes in pieces, but because tracking continuous change across seven qualities exceeds cognitive capacity. Good chunks work with, not against, these natural cognitive boundaries.

### The Art of Compromise

The framework is honest that any chunking involves compromise:

> "We work with discrete moments not because experience comes in pieces, but because human understanding and communication require manageable units. The art lies in creating representations that honor the flow they necessarily interrupt."

The goal isn't perfect segmentation (impossible) but useful segmentation that preserves as much experiential richness as possible within the constraints of language and memory.

## LLM Pileline Overview

This specification defines an LLM pipeline for processing experiential text into Framed Moments - discrete units of experience characterized by seven phenomenological qualities. The pipeline segments continuous experiential data and outputs quality vectors suitable for AI knowledge systems.

## Core Principles

- **Chunking**: Based solely on shifts in experiential qualities
- **Analysis**: Scores only the seven defined qualities
- **Hierarchy**: Preserves natural story structure at multiple grain sizes
- **First-Person**: Always analyzes from single experiencer perspective
- **Source-Agnostic**: Same pipeline regardless of content type or processing level
- **Output**: Quality vectors for AI processing, optional prose for humans

## The Seven Qualities

Each moment is characterized by these qualities, scored 0.0-1.0:

1. **Embodied Presence** - Physical sensations, body awareness
2. **Attentional Flow** - Focus patterns and awareness movement  
3. **Affective Atmosphere** - Emotional tone and mood
4. **Purposive Momentum** - Goal direction and intention
5. **Spatial Situation** - Sense of place and position
6. **Temporal Flow** - Time experience and pacing
7. **Intersubjective Field** - Social presence and recognition

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Raw Input → Preprocessing → Hierarchical Segmentation / Quality Analysis → Output Generation
```
## Processing Phases

### Preprocessing Notes
- **For multi-experiencer content**: Separate each person's experiential content before processing
- **Metadata inference**: When metadata not provided, preprocessing may attempt to:
  - Detect multiple speakers (set experiencer names if found)
  - Identify temporal markers in content
  - Recognize source type patterns
- **Source-agnostic**: Apply same preprocessing regardless of content type

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Segmentation
Process text at multiple grain sizes to create nested moment structure:

- Step 1: Coarse Segmentation (Life Chapters/Major Periods)
- Step 2: Medium Segmentation (Scenes/Episodes)  
- Step 3: Fine Segmentation (Moments)


#### Hierarchical Structure Rules:
1. Every moment must have a grain size level
2. Fine moments must have a medium parent (or be promoted)
3. Medium moments must have a coarse parent (or be promoted)
4. Overlapping segments are not allowed - strict nesting
5. Preserve sequence order within each parent


#### Quality Inheritance Patterns:
- Child moments exist within parent's quality context
- Significant departures from parent qualities signal important moments
- Quality stability across levels indicates coherent experience
- Quality volatility suggests transitional or conflicted periods

For each segment at each level, score all seven qualities 0.0-1.0:

#### Scoring Rubric:
- **0.0-0.2**: Minimal/absent
- **0.3-0.4**: Present but backgrounded
- **0.5-0.6**: Noticeable and contributing
- **0.7-0.8**: Prominent feature
- **0.9-1.0**: Dominant/defining

### Phase 4: Output Generation

Generate quality vector and optional prose based on use case:

- **AI Systems**: Quality vector only
- **Human Review**: Include prose narrative
- **Hybrid**: Both vector and prose

## 7. Quality Scoring Guidelines

### Embodied Presence
- 0.1: Body implied but not felt
- 0.3: Single sensation mentioned
- 0.5: Multiple physical details
- 0.7: Rich bodily experience
- 0.9: Physical experience dominates

### Attentional Flow  
- 0.1: Implied awareness only
- 0.3: Simple focus noted
- 0.5: Clear attention pattern
- 0.7: Complex attention dynamics
- 0.9: Attention itself is central

### Affective Atmosphere
- 0.1: Emotional tone implied
- 0.3: Basic emotion named
- 0.5: Clear emotional quality
- 0.7: Rich emotional texture
- 0.9: Emotion saturates everything

### Purposive Momentum
- 0.1: Drift without direction
- 0.3: Vague intention present
- 0.5: Clear goal or purpose
- 0.7: Strong directional pull
- 0.9: Purpose drives everything

### Spatial Situation
- 0.1: Location barely noted
- 0.3: Basic spatial awareness
- 0.5: Clear sense of place
- 0.7: Rich spatial experience
- 0.9: Space is primary feature

### Temporal Flow
- 0.1: Time unmarked
- 0.3: Basic temporal markers
- 0.5: Clear time experience
- 0.7: Time distortion/thickness
- 0.9: Temporal experience central

### Intersubjective Field
- 0.1: Others barely present
- 0.3: Others mentioned
- 0.5: Clear social dynamic
- 0.7: Rich relational experience
- 0.9: Recognition/connection central

### Multiple Experiencers
- **Issue**: Meeting transcripts, group chats with multiple perspectives
- **Solution**: Process each experiencer's content separately through pipeline
- **Note**: Same event yields different moments for different experiencers
- **Example**: Extract Miguel's experiential content → analyze; Extract Sal's → analyze separately

### Reflections on Same Experience
- **Issue**: Same event captured/reflected upon multiple times
- **Solution**: Treat each reflection as distinct moment with unique qualities
- **Key Insight**: The act of remembering IS the experience being analyzed
- **Example**: 
  - Original: "Sal says I should be a designer" (high intersubjective)
  - Week later: "Can't stop thinking about Sal's advice" (high purposive)
  - Years later: "That car moment changed everything" (high temporal)
- **Linking**: Use reflection_context to connect related moments

## Search and Knowledge Graph Integration
Vector Similarity Search, Semantic Search, Graph Traversal, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Support

### Graph Structure for Advanced Queries

#### Nodes (Moments)
- Properties: quality_vector, summary, metadata
- Indexed: quality dimensions, embeddings, temporal position

#### Edges (Relationships)
- Hierarchical: parent/child
- Temporal: previous/next
- Semantic: computed similarity above threshold
- Experiencer: same person's moments


### Metadata Layer for Human Exploration
The compressed summaries + emojis create a scannable meta-layer:
- 💡 "Turn to me: 'Think like designer'"
- 🚗 "Start getting rides, skip hour bus commute"
- 💻 "Build websites fast, feeling burnt out"

This enables rapid human scanning while maintaining full searchability via:
- Quality patterns (find all 💡 moments via high purposive+intersubjective)
- Semantic similarity (find moments "like this one")
- Temporal progression (see life chapters at a glance)
- Source retrieval (get full context when needed)

### The Metalayer: Reflection as Experience

The act of remembering has its own experiential qualities:
- **Temporal Flow**: Past and present merge in the remembering
- **Affective Atmosphere**: Current emotions color past events
- **Attentional Flow**: What details surface in this telling
- **Intersubjective**: Who the rememberer has become

Score the qualities of the remembering, not the remembered event.

### Queries Enabled
- "Show how understanding of moment X evolved over time"
- "Find all reflections with temporal_distance > 5 years"
- "Track quality vector changes across reflection chain"
- "Identify moments that gain significance over time"


## Future Directions: Toward a Pattern Language of Experience

### Inspired by Christopher Alexander

Just as Alexander identified recurring patterns in architecture that create life and wholeness, the quality vectors enable discovery of recurring patterns in human experience that create meaning and aliveness.

### Experiential Pattern Components

Future analysis could develop a pattern catalog where each pattern includes:
- **Pattern Name**: e.g., "Recognition from Unexpected Source"
- **Quality Signature**: Typical vector configuration (not rigid, but recognizable)
- **Context**: When this pattern tends to emerge
- **Experiential Impact**: What this pattern creates or enables
- **Connections**: How it relates to other patterns

### Example Patterns to Explore

- **"Threshold Moments"**: Spatial transition + purposive shift
- **"Creative Breakthrough"**: Low purposive struggle → sudden clarity spike  
- **"Morning Clarity"**: High attention + low temporal in early hours
- **"Recognition Cascade"**: Intersubjective spike → purposive redirect
- **"Embodied Knowing"**: High embodied + attentional convergence
- **"Collaborative Flow"**: Matched purposive + shared attention rhythms

### Pattern Language Development

Like Alexander's patterns, these would:
- Compose hierarchically (moment patterns → scene patterns → life patterns)
- Describe quality relationships rather than fixed values
- Adapt to individual and cultural contexts
- Form a generative language for experience design

### Applications

A mature pattern language could enable:
- **Life Design**: Compose patterns that create meaningful experiences
- **Intervention Design**: Recognize and shift problematic patterns
- **Cultural Translation**: Understand pattern variations across contexts
- **Predictive Modeling**: Anticipate likely pattern sequences
- **Experience Architecture**: Design environments/systems that facilitate positive patterns

This transforms the pipeline from a processing system into a foundation for understanding the deep structures of human experience.

### Pattern Discovery and Clustering

The quality vectors and relationship structure enable sophisticated pattern analysis:

- **Quality signature clustering**: Find moments with similar experiential profiles
- **Temporal pattern recognition**: Identify recurring sequences and trajectories  
- **Hierarchical pattern analysis**: Discover how moments nest and influence each other
- **Cross-experiencer patterns**: Find universal vs. unique experiential patterns
- **Transformation detection**: Identify moments of significant quality shifts

These patterns support applications in:
- Design research (user journey optimization)
- Personal insight generation  
- Behavioral prediction
- Experience design
- Cultural analysis
