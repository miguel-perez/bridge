# Framed Moments MCP Server Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for capturing and framing moments of experience. The server provides tools for quick capture, thoughtful framing, enhancement, and synthesis of experiential moments.

## Current State
- Initial project setup completed
- Basic MCP server implemented with stdio transport
- Core types defined in types.ts
- JSONL chosen as storage format
- All 4 tools have placeholder implementations
- Server tested and working with MCP protocol
- Integrated with Cursor via .cursor/mcp.json

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize npm project with TypeScript
- [x] Add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency
- [x] Configure TypeScript and build scripts
- [x] Set up development environment

### 2. Core Server Implementation
- [x] Create basic MCP server with stdio transport
- [x] Implement server initialization and connection handling
- [x] Set up error handling and logging
- [x] Test server with MCP protocol messages
- [x] Configure Cursor integration

### 3. Storage Layer
- [ ] Create JSONL file storage utilities
- [ ] Implement atomic write operations
- [ ] Add basic query capabilities
- [ ] Set up data validation

### 4. Tool Implementation
- [x] Implement `capture` tool (placeholder)
  - [x] Add input validation
  - [ ] Create storage handler
  - [x] Add error handling
  
- [x] Implement `frame` tool (placeholder)
  - [ ] Add source validation
  - [ ] Implement framing logic
  - [ ] Add pattern recognition
  
- [x] Implement `enhance` tool (placeholder)
  - [ ] Add moment/source lookup
  - [ ] Implement update logic
  - [x] Add validation rules
  
- [x] Implement `synthesize` tool (placeholder)
  - [ ] Add moment grouping logic
  - [ ] Implement synthesis creation
  - [ ] Add relationship tracking

### 5. Testing
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest configured)
- [x] Manual server testing completed
- [ ] Add unit tests for each tool
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create test fixtures

## Technical Decisions

### Storage
- Using JSONL for:
  - Simple append-only operations
  - Easy backup and restore
  - Human-readable format
  - Efficient line-by-line processing

### Transport
- Starting with stdio transport for:
  - Simple local development
  - Easy debugging
  - Direct integration with MCP clients

### Type System
- Using TypeScript for:
  - Strong type safety
  - Better development experience
  - Easy integration with MCP SDK

## Notes & Learnings

### 2025-01-02
- Initial project setup completed
- Created all necessary configuration files:
  - package.json with dependencies (including bin configuration)
  - tsconfig.json for TypeScript
  - jest.config.js for testing
  - .eslintrc and .prettierrc for code quality
  - .gitignore for version control
- Created README.md with basic documentation
- Implemented basic MCP server:
  - Created types.ts with all interfaces from design
  - Implemented index.ts with stdio transport
  - Added all 4 tools with placeholder handlers
  - Set up proper error handling with Zod validation
  - Successfully builds and compiles
- Updated tool definitions to match design document:
  - Added missing fields to capture tool (experiencer, related, file)
  - Enhanced descriptions with valid options
  - Fixed description texts for all tools
- Created .cursor/mcp.json configuration:
  - Server named "moments" 
  - Configured to run with Node.js
  - Successfully integrated with Cursor
- Tested server manually:
  - Verified JSON-RPC protocol handling
  - Confirmed all 4 tools are properly exposed
  - Tested capture and frame tool calls
  - Server responds correctly to MCP messages
- Ready to implement storage layer

## Questions to Resolve
- [ ] Best practices for handling concurrent writes to JSONL
- [ ] Strategy for implementing search across JSONL files
- [ ] Approach for handling large datasets
- [ ] Method for ensuring data integrity
