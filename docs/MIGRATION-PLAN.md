# Bridge Data Migration Plan

**Document Purpose**: This outlines the migration strategy for converting legacy Bridge data to the new Bridge schema, including quality mapping, emoji selection, and embedding regeneration.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand the migration process and validate the results.

## Migration Overview

### Dataset Analysis
- **Total Sources**: 374 experiences
- **Primary Experiencer**: Alicia (343 experiences, 92%)
- **Processing Types**: during (321), right-after (32), long-after (16), crafted (5)
- **Quality Distribution**: purposive (311), attentional (266), temporal (238), intersubjective (199), affective (170), embodied (71), spatial (30)

### Migration Strategy

#### 1. **Quality Mapping**
| Legacy Quality | Bridge Quality | Transformation |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| `affective` | `mood` | Emotional atmosphere |
| `embodied` | `embodied` | Direct match |
| `attentional` | `focus` | Attentional quality |
| `purposive` | `purpose` | Directional momentum |
| `temporal` | `time` | Temporal orientation |
| `spatial` | `space` | Spatial awareness |
| `intersubjective` | `presence` | Social quality |

#### 2. **Quality Transformation Rules**
- **prominence > 0.3** → Use manifestation text
- **prominence < 0.3** → Set to `false`

#### 3. **Emoji Selection Strategy**
Manual emoji selection based on content and quality types:

| Content Type | Emoji | Triggers |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Emotional distress | 😔 | affective, cry, tears, sad, overwhelm |
| Anxiety/worry | 😟 | anxiety, nervous, worry, stress |
| Joy/happiness | 😊 | joy, happy, excited, thrilled |
| Anger/frustration | 😤 | anger, frustrated, mad, irritated |
| Embodied/physical | 💪 | embodied, body, physical, sensation |
| Fatigue/tired | 😴 | tired, exhausted, fatigue, sleep |
| Focus/attention | 🔍 | attentional, focus, concentrate, mind |
| Purpose/goals | 🎯 | purposive, goal, purpose, intention |
| Temporal/time | ⏰ | temporal, time, moment, past, future |
| Spatial/place | 📍 | spatial, place, location, here, there |
| Social/interpersonal | 👥 | intersubjective, people, social, others |
| Creative/artistic | ✨ | poem, art, creative, write |
| Work/productivity | 💼 | work, project, task, productive |
| Learning/insight | 💡 | learn, insight, understand, realize |
| Default reflection | 🤔 | General experiential content |

#### 4. **Context Building**
Combines legacy fields into single context string:
```
"Occurred on {date}. From {perspective} perspective. Processed {processing}."
```

#### 5. **Embedding Regeneration**
- Uses OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model
- Regenerates all embeddings for compatibility with new Bridge system
- Maintains source ID relationships

## Migration Script

### Usage
```bash
# Dry run (no file output)
npm run migrate -- --dry-run

# Basic migration
npm run migrate -- --output data/migration/migrated.bridge.json

# With embedding regeneration
npm run migrate -- --regenerate-embeddings --openai-key sk-...

# Custom batch size
npm run migrate -- --batch-size 20

# Custom input/output files
npm run migrate -- --input data/legacy.json --output data/new.json
```

### Options
- `--input <file>`: Input file path (default: `data/migration/2025.07.27.backup.bridge.json`)
- `--output <file>`: Output file path (default: `data/migration/migrated.bridge.json`)
- `--openai-key <key>`: OpenAI API key for embedding regeneration
- `--batch-size <number>`: Batch size for processing (default: 10)
- `--dry-run`: Don't write output files
- `--regenerate-embeddings`: Regenerate embeddings using OpenAI

## Migration Results

### Quality Mapping Validation
✅ All 7 quality types successfully mapped:
- `affective` → `mood`
- `embodied` → `embodied`
- `intersubjective` → `presence`
- `temporal` → `time`
- `purposive` → `purpose`
- `attentional` → `focus`
- `spatial` → `space`

### Emoji Distribution
Based on 374 experiences:
- 😔 (Emotional distress): 174 (46.5%)
- 🔍 (Focus/attention): 123 (32.9%)
- 💪 (Embodied/physical): 26 (7.0%)

## LLM Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Quality Analysis (Next Priority)
**Goal**: Use LLM to analyze conversation content and generate more accurate experiential qualities

**Approach**:
1. **Batch Processing**: Process experiences in batches of 50-100
2. **LLM Analysis**: Use Claude to analyze each experience and suggest qualities
3. **Quality Validation**: Compare LLM suggestions with keyword-based detection
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Rate quality suggestions by confidence level

**LLM Prompt Template**:
```
Analyze this experiential content and suggest Bridge qualities:

Content: "{source}"
Sender: {who}
Context: {context}

Available qualities:
- embodied.thinking, embodied.sensing
- focus.narrow, focus.broad  
- mood.open, mood.closed
- purpose.goal, purpose.wander
- space.here, space.there
- time.past, time.future
- presence.individual, presence.collective

Return JSON with qualities array and confidence score (1-10):
{
  "qualities": ["embodied.thinking", "focus.narrow"],
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of quality selection"
}
```

### Phase 2: Emoji Enhancement
**Goal**: Use LLM to suggest more contextually appropriate emojis

**Approach**:
1. **Content Analysis**: LLM analyzes emotional and contextual content
2. **Emoji Mapping**: Map content to Bridge's emoji vocabulary
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure emoji selection aligns with qualities

### Phase 3: Context Enrichment
**Goal**: Generate richer context from conversation metadata

**Approach**:
1. **Conversation Analysis**: Extract conversation themes and patterns
2. **Temporal Context**: Add time-based context (time of day, day of week)
3. **Relationship Context**: Identify conversation participants and dynamics

### Phase 4: Pattern Recognition
**Goal**: Identify experiential patterns across conversations

**Approach**:
1. **Cross-Conversation Analysis**: Find recurring themes and experiences
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Identify time-based patterns (weekly rhythms, etc.)
3. **Quality Evolution**: Track how qualities change over time

## Implementation Strategy

### Batch Processing Script
```typescript
interface LLMEnhancement {
  id: string;
  qualities: string[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  emoji?: string;
  context?: string;
}

async function enhanceWithLLM(
  experiences: BridgeExperience[], 
  batchSize: number = 50
): Promise<LLMEnhancement[]> {
  // Process in batches to avoid rate limits
  // Use OpenAI API for quality analysis
  // Return enhanced experiences with confidence scores
}
```

### Quality Validation
- Compare LLM suggestions with keyword detection
- Flag high-confidence disagreements for manual review
- Track quality distribution changes
- Validate against Bridge's quality framework

### Performance Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Process in small batches (50-100 experiences)
- **Caching**: Cache LLM responses to avoid re-processing
- **Fallback**: Use keyword detection when LLM fails
- **Progress Tracking**: Log enhancement progress and statistics

## Success Metrics

### Quality Improvement
- **Accuracy**: Compare LLM vs keyword detection quality assignment
- **Coverage**: Percentage of experiences with quality assignments
- **Confidence**: Average confidence scores for quality suggestions
- **Consistency**: Quality distribution across conversation types

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: Time to enhance all 9,552 experiences
- **API Usage**: OpenAI API calls and costs
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed LLM analyses
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of cached vs new analyses

### Bridge Integration
- **Search Performance**: Impact on recall and search functionality
- **Quality Filtering**: Effectiveness of enhanced quality filtering
- **User Experience**: Improved experience discovery and pattern recognition

## Next Steps

1. **Implement LLM Enhancement Script**: Create batch processing with OpenAI API
2. **Quality Analysis Pilot**: Test on 100 experiences to validate approach
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize batch sizes and caching
4. **Full Enhancement**: Process all 9,552 experiences
5. **Validation**: Test enhanced experiences with Bridge functionality
6. **Deployment**: Replace current experiences with enhanced versions

## Risk Mitigation

### API Limitations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
- **Cost Control**: Set budget limits and monitor API usage
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use keyword detection when LLM unavailable

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: Manual review of high-confidence disagreements
- **Consistency**: Ensure quality assignments align with Bridge framework
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Bridge search and filtering

### Data Integrity
- **Backup**: Preserve original experiences before enhancement
- **Versioning**: Track enhancement versions and changes
- **Rollback**: Ability to revert to original experiences if needed
