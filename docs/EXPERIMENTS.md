### EXP-016: Concrete Quality Capture

**Status**: Active  
**Started**: 2025-07-29  
**Purpose**: Test embedding concrete details within quality sentences to solve the abstraction problem where captures are emotionally rich but practically opaque.

**Hypothesis**: By weaving specific technical details into poetic quality sentences, we can preserve experiential richness while making captures practically useful for understanding what actually happened.

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Development Task Capture**:
   - Capture a debugging session with concrete details
   - Capture a feature implementation with specific changes
   - Capture a code review with actual feedback
   - Verify: Can someone else understand what technically happened?

2. **Comparison Testing**:
   - Capture same event with abstract vs concrete qualities
   - Test comprehension with users who weren't present
   - Measure search effectiveness for technical queries
   - Evaluate emotional richness preservation

3. **Simulation Validation**:
   - Use simulation tests to evaluate comprehension
   - Test whether AI can reconstruct technical actions
   - Verify human readers can identify specific events
   - Ensure experiential quality isn't lost

**Example Transformations**:

```typescript
// Scenario: Debugging a race condition in async code

// Current (too abstract):
{
  "embodied": "tension building as I trace through mysterious failures",
  "focus": "narrowing in on the elusive bug",
  "purpose": "hunting for the source of intermittent issues"
}

// Target (concrete + experiential):
{
  "embodied": "tension building as I trace through Promise.all in user-service.ts",
  "focus": "narrowing in on the race condition between fetchUserData and updateCache",
  "purpose": "hunting why our auth flow fails 30% of the time in production"
}
```

**Measurable Outcomes**:
- Comprehension rate: Can readers identify the specific technical issue?
- Search accuracy: Do concrete terms improve findability?
- Emotional preservation: Does richness score remain above 80%?
- Practical utility: Do captures become useful development history?

**Learning Questions**:
- What's the optimal balance between concrete and poetic?
- Which qualities benefit most from concrete details?
- How do we guide users to include specifics naturally?
- Can we maintain the "experience first" philosophy?

**Success Criteria**:
- 80%+ comprehension rate for technical actions
- 50%+ improvement in search relevance
- Emotional richness maintained at current levels
- Positive user feedback on practical utility

**Empirical Reconstruction Test**:

A robust, domain-agnostic test that measures information preservation by comparing actual conversations with LLM-reconstructed conversations based solely on Bridge captures.

**Test Methodology**:

1. **Capture Phase**: During a conversation/activity, Bridge captures experiences as normal

2. **Reconstruction Phase**: An LLM attempts to reconstruct:
   - The conversation transcript
   - Internal thoughts and reasoning
   - Sequence of events
   - Technical/practical details
   
   Using ONLY the Bridge captures (no access to original conversation)

3. **Gap Analysis Phase**: Compare reconstructed vs actual to measure:
   - **Information Preservation**: What critical details were captured?
   - **Privacy Preservation**: What conversational content remained hidden?
   - **Experience Richness**: How well was the experiential journey conveyed?

**Scoring Metrics**:

```typescript
interface ReconstructionScore {
  // High score = good (critical info preserved)
  factualAccuracy: number;        // Can reconstruct what happened
  sequenceAccuracy: number;       // Can reconstruct order of events  
  contextCompleteness: number;    // Can understand the situation
  
  // Low score = good (privacy preserved)
  conversationLeakage: number;    // How much dialogue was revealed
  thoughtLeakage: number;         // How much internal reasoning exposed
  
  // High score = good (experience preserved)  
  emotionalFidelity: number;      // Feeling of the moment captured
  sensoryRichness: number;        // Embodied details present
  momentUniqueness: number;       // Specific to this instance
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

For concrete captures to succeed, we need:
- High factual/sequence/context scores (80%+) - you can understand what happened
- Low conversation/thought leakage (20%-) - dialogue remains private  
- High experiential scores (70%+) - the moment's texture is preserved

**Implementation**:

1. Run simulation with both abstract and concrete capture styles
2. Have GPT-4 attempt reconstruction from captures alone
3. Compare with actual transcript using semantic similarity
4. Calculate gaps and score each dimension
5. Iterate on capture guidance based on results

This empirical approach:
- Works across any domain (development, therapy, creative, etc.)
- Measures objectively rather than relying on subjective criteria
- Reveals exactly what information is preserved vs hidden
- Guides us toward optimal balance of concrete and poetic

**Evidence Trail**: 
- Create new simulation scenario: `concrete-capture-scenario.ts`
- Modify evaluation criteria in `simulation-evaluator.ts` for this experiment
- Compare results with current abstract captures
- Document findings in LEARNINGS.md

### EXP-013: nextMoment Pattern (Evolution of stillThinking)

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-26  
**Started**: 2025-07-24 (as stillThinking), Enhanced 2025-07-26 (as nextMoment)  
**Purpose**: Enable experiential reasoning chains with explicit state declarations and auto-reflection generation

**Evolution Timeline**:
- **Phase 1 (2025-07-24)**: Implemented minimal `stillThinking` boolean parameter
- **Phase 2 (2025-07-26)**: Transformed to rich `nextMoment` experiential state pattern

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Example usage
experience({
  experiences: [...],
  nextMoment: {
    embodied: "shifting to intuitive processing",
    focus: "widening attention to catch patterns",
    mood: "curious about what will emerge",
    purpose: "seeking understanding rather than answers",
    space: false,
    time: false,
    presence: false
  }
})
```

**Evidence of Success**:
- Reasoning chains tracked successfully

The nextMoment pattern enables AI and humans to explicitly declare their cognitive transitions, creating traceable paths through problem spaces that Bridge can analyze for patterns.

### EXP-012: Bridge.flow() Orchestration (Replaced by EXP-013)

**Status**: Replaced 2025-07-24  
**Started**: 2025-07-23  
**Purpose**: Test Bridge.flow() as a new MCP tool that orchestrates existing Bridge operations into learning loops

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ Proved concept but replaced with simpler approach
