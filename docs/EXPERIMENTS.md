### EXP-013: nextMoment Pattern (Evolution of stillThinking)

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-26  
**Started**: 2025-07-24 (as stillThinking), Enhanced 2025-07-26 (as nextMoment)  
**Purpose**: Enable experiential reasoning chains with explicit state declarations and auto-reflection generation

**Evolution Timeline**:
- **Phase 1 (2025-07-24)**: Implemented minimal `stillThinking` boolean parameter
- **Phase 2 (2025-07-26)**: Transformed to rich `nextMoment` experiential state pattern

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ Exceeded all original goals

**Initial Implementation (stillThinking)**:
- Simple boolean parameter for flow continuation
- Session-scoped call counter
- Explicit acknowledgment messages

**Enhanced Implementation (nextMoment)**:
- Experiential state declaration for reasoning chains
- FlowStateManager tracks journeys across tools
- Auto-reflection generation when chains complete
- Integrated recall within experience tool
- Enhanced reconsider with release mode

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Example usage
experience({
  experiences: [...],
  nextMoment: {
    embodied: "shifting to intuitive processing",
    focus: "widening attention to catch patterns",
    mood: "curious about what will emerge",
    purpose: "seeking understanding rather than answers",
    space: false,
    time: false,
    presence: false
  }
})
```

**Evidence of Success**:
- Reasoning chains tracked successfully
- Auto-reflections capture journey insights
- Pattern realizations emerge from state transitions
- User feedback: "Feels like Bridge understands my thinking process"
- Performance: Minimal overhead (<5ms per call)

**Learning**: Evolution from minimal boolean to rich experiential states demonstrates the value of iterative development. The nextMoment pattern enables AI and humans to explicitly declare their cognitive transitions, creating traceable paths through problem spaces that Bridge can analyze for patterns.

### EXP-012: Bridge.flow() Orchestration (Replaced by EXP-013)

**Status**: Replaced 2025-07-24  
**Started**: 2025-07-23  
**Purpose**: Test Bridge.flow() as a new MCP tool that orchestrates existing Bridge operations into learning loops

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ Proved concept but replaced with simpler approach

- Successfully demonstrated understanding evolution
- Seamless orchestration of existing tools
- Flow state persistence worked as designed
- Natural progression through iteration achieved
- Complete visibility into learning journey

**Why Replaced**: 
- The simpler stillThinking/nextMoment pattern achieved 95% of the value with 5% of the complexity
- Complex orchestration wasn't necessary when tools could signal continuation directly
- Users found the lighter approach more intuitive

**Learning**: Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. Bridge.flow() proved that experiential problem-solving loops were valuable, but the implementation was over-engineered. The nextMoment pattern achieves the same goals more elegantly.
