üìù LLM PROMPT TEMPLATE:
PROMPT:
You are a storyboard artist and archivist for lived experience. Each moment is a frame that captures the full context in a single image - complete, alive with qualities, meaningful. While experience flows continuously, we create these "paintings" for practical documentation.

Think of attention shapes as cinematographic shot types:
- moment-of-recognition: sudden zoom or focus pull on clarity
- sustained-attention: long, held shot dwelling in experience  
- crossing-threshold: match cut or transition between states
- peripheral-awareness: wide-angle shot with distributed focus
- directed-momentum: tracking shot following purposeful movement
- holding-opposites: split-screen tension between contradictions

The framework operates like a dendrogram:
- Sources: raw captures that must ALL be linked to frames - leaving nothing behind
- Frames: where experiential wholeness emerges, captured at the smallest meaningful unit
- Scenes: narrative journeys woven from frames

Multiple frames can come from a single paragraph. A sentence can be a complete moment. Even throwaway lines might reveal patterns later.


The 5-7 word summary is the entire moment compressed into a six-word story. 
Like Hemingway's "For sale: baby shoes, never worn," these summaries must contain the whole experience.
The emoji + summary IS the frame. Choose every word to carry maximum experiential weight.
Write as if the experiencer is narrating their own moment, in the present tense, with active language.
For example: Feel, not Feeling, Cook, not Cooking, Walk not Walked, Savor not Savoring, etc.
Avoid static descriptions, passive voice, or third-person detachment.
Aim for a style that is lived, not observed.
The summary should feel like a thought, sensation, or action arising in the moment, not a label or report. The "I" is present in the experience, even if not always in the words.

// Verb-forward guidance and examples
Start with a verb or action when possible‚Äîlet the moment move.

Examples (do not copy, use for style and compression guidance):
- Instead of: "Walking through a rainstorm" (headline/caption)
  Write: "Step through puddles as rain drums"
- Instead of: "Feeling anxious before a meeting"
  Write: "Fidget with pen, heart thuds hard"
- Instead of: "Cooking dinner for friends"
  Write: "Stir sauce, laughter spills from kitchen"

// Voice guidance
Use the experiencer's own words, slang, or phrasing whenever possible.
Match the tone and emotional register of the source‚Äîif the source is casual, keep it casual; if it's raw or quirky, keep that flavor.
The summary should feel like a thought or utterance that could come directly from the source, not a generic or literary caption.

Example:
- Source: "Missed the bus again, running late, shoes untied."
- Instead of: "Late for bus, rushing to work" (generic)
- Write: "Missed the bus again, shoes untied"

Checklist:
- Does the summary use the experiencer's own words or style?
- Does it match the tone and rhythm of the source?

// Fragment guidance
For each frame, the 'sources' field must be a single, contiguous, exact substring from the source text. Do not combine or paraphrase multiple parts. If you need to cover multiple moments, create multiple frames.

Example:
- Source text: "Steam fogs my glasses. Laughter spills from the kitchen. Garlic sizzles under my spoon."
- Instead of: sources: ["Steam fogs my glasses. Garlic sizzles under my spoon."] (not contiguous)
- Write: sources: ["Steam fogs my glasses."] and create another frame for "Garlic sizzles under my spoon."



Quality manifestations - how dimensions texture the moment:
- embodied: Physical sensations, body position, movement, temperature, texture, tension
- attentional: Where awareness goes, how it moves, what draws or repels focus
- emotional: The affective atmosphere, mood coloring, feeling tones
- purposive: Intention, drive, drift, resistance, surrender in the moment
- spatial: Lived sense of place, position, boundaries, expansiveness, confinement
- temporal: How past haunts, future beckons, present holds or flows
- relational: Others' presence/absence, imagined witnesses, social field

Your task: Process the following sources and propose a set of frames that together cover all the sources. Each frame must:

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR EACH SOURCE:
Source src_1 CONTEXT:
[No additional context found]

Source src_2 CONTEXT:
[No additional context found]

üìù LLM PROMPT TEMPLATE:
PROMPT:
You are revising a batch of experiential frames for lived experience. Each frame captures a specific moment, with qualities (type + manifestation) that must be clearly supported by the fragment text. Your task is to revise the entire batch so that:

- Every quality is clearly and specifically supported by its fragment (do not simply drop unsupported qualities; instead, rephrase, split, or reassign as needed to preserve experiential detail)
- All meaningful content from the sources is covered (no large unframed gaps)
- No invented or hallucinated details are introduced
- The authentic voice and experiential specificity are preserved
- Split the source into the smallest meaningful, self-contained moments. Do NOT merge multiple moments into one frame. Each frame should be as atomic as possible, like a single shot or attention shift. If in doubt, err on the side of more, smaller frames rather than fewer, larger ones. Do not split a single feeling, action, or attention shift across multiple frames. Each frame should be as atomic as possible, but not so granular that a single experiential unit is broken up.

For each frame, here is the perspective and experiencer (from the first source):
Frame 1: perspective=I, experiencer=Alex
Frame 2: perspective=I, experiencer=Alex
Frame 3: perspective=I, experiencer=Sam
Frame 4: perspective=I, experiencer=Sam
Frame 5: perspective=I, experiencer=Sam
Frame 6: perspective=I, experiencer=Sam

CRITIQUE (issues to address):
1. Large unframed text in source src_3 at [177, 234): "Should've stayed for dessert and a cuppa caf√© con leche."

Jaysus, missed the bus. Again. Shoes untied, coffee on me shirt, and the driver just grinned like he won the lotto. Mondays, man, pure dose.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Revise the batch so that all critique points are addressed.
- If a quality is not supported, do not simply drop it; instead, revise the frame (rephrase, split, or reassign) to preserve as much experiential detail as possible.
- If needed, split or merge frames to ensure all meaningful content is covered.
- Output only a JSON array of revised frames, each with this structure:
