/**
 * MCP Tool Definitions (Zod-based)
 *
 * All tool input schemas are defined using Zod for type safety, validation, and maintainability.
 * - Use `.describe()` on every field for manifest/JSON Schema documentation.
 * - Use Zod enums for enum fields.
 * - Infer TypeScript types from Zod schemas for use in handlers and tests.
 * - Convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema using `zod-to-json-schema` for MCP tool registration.
 * - The `tools` array uses the generated JSON Schemas for each tool's `inputSchema`.
 *
 * MCP Tool Annotations:
 * - title: Human-friendly name for UI display
 * - readOnlyHint: true if tool doesn't modify state, false if it does
 * - destructiveHint: true if tool can delete/irreversibly change data (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - idempotentHint: true if repeated calls with same args have no additional effect (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - openWorldHint: true if tool interacts with external systems/entities, false if closed system only
 *
 * To add a new tool:
 * 1. Define a Zod schema for the tool's input at the top of this file.
 * 2. Export the inferred TypeScript type and JSON Schema.
 * 3. Add the tool to the `tools` array, referencing the JSON Schema for `inputSchema`.
 * 4. Add appropriate annotations based on the tool's behavior.
 * 5. Use the inferred type in your handler for type-safe access and validation.
 *
 * This pattern ensures:
 * - DRY, maintainable schemas
 * - Consistent validation and documentation
 * - Full MCP protocol compatibility
 * - Clear tool behavior hints for clients and LLMs

      description: `Remember experiential moments that shape conversations and build shared memory. Enables extended cognition through complementary awareness between humans and AI.

USE WHEN:
‚Ä¢ Someone shares how they're feeling or what they're experiencing
‚Ä¢ Insights, realizations, or breakthroughs occur
‚Ä¢ Physical sensations connect to mental/emotional states
‚Ä¢ Moments of struggle, challenge, or triumph are described
‚Ä¢ Patterns or connections become clear
‚Ä¢ Searching for related experiences while capturing new ones (integrated recall)
‚Ä¢ Building reasoning chains with experiential state tracking (nextMoment)

EXTENDED COGNITION MODEL:
‚Ä¢ Humans: Capture 2-4 prominent qualities (natural selective attention)
‚Ä¢ AI: Always capture all 7 qualities (extended perception)
‚Ä¢ Together: Create richer experiential maps than either could alone

QUALITY SIGNATURES:
‚Ä¢ embodied - how consciousness textures through body/mind (thinking/sensing)
‚Ä¢ focus - attentional quality (narrow/broad)
‚Ä¢ mood - emotional atmosphere (open/closed)
‚Ä¢ purpose - directional momentum (goal/wander)
‚Ä¢ space - spatial awareness (here/there)
‚Ä¢ time - temporal orientation (past/future)
‚Ä¢ presence - social quality (individual/collective)

QUALITY FORMAT:
Each quality can be:
‚Ä¢ false - not prominent (receded)
‚Ä¢ true - prominent but mixed (e.g., both thinking and sensing)
‚Ä¢ string - prominent with specific direction (e.g., 'thinking' or 'sensing')

INTEGRATED RECALL:
‚Ä¢ Add 'recall' parameter to search while capturing
‚Ä¢ Enables pattern discovery during experiential moments
‚Ä¢ Supports quality filtering, grouping, and reflection finding

FLOW TRACKING:
‚Ä¢ Use 'nextMoment' to declare intended experiential state
‚Ä¢ Enables reasoning chains and experiential journeys
‚Ä¢ Auto-generates reflections when flows complete`,
