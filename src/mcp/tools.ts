/**
 * MCP Tool Definitions (Zod-based)
 *
 * All tool input schemas are defined using Zod for type safety, validation, and maintainability.
 * - Use `.describe()` on every field for manifest/JSON Schema documentation.
 * - Use Zod enums for enum fields.
 * - Infer TypeScript types from Zod schemas for use in handlers and tests.
 * - Convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema using `zod-to-json-schema` for MCP tool registration.
 * - The `tools` array uses the generated JSON Schemas for each tool's `inputSchema`.
 *
 * MCP Tool Annotations:
 * - title: Human-friendly name for UI display
 * - readOnlyHint: true if tool doesn't modify state, false if it does
 * - destructiveHint: true if tool can delete/irreversibly change data (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - idempotentHint: true if repeated calls with same args have no additional effect (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - openWorldHint: true if tool interacts with external systems/entities, false if closed system only
 *
 * To add a new tool:
 * 1. Define a Zod schema for the tool's input at the top of this file.
 * 2. Export the inferred TypeScript type and JSON Schema.
 * 3. Add the tool to the `tools` array, referencing the JSON Schema for `inputSchema`.
 * 4. Add appropriate annotations based on the tool's behavior.
 * 5. Use the inferred type in your handler for type-safe access and validation.
 *
 * This pattern ensures:
 * - DRY, maintainable schemas
 * - Consistent validation and documentation
 * - Full MCP protocol compatibility
 * - Clear tool behavior hints for clients and LLMs

      description: `Remember experiences as framed moments. Based on FRAMED_MOMENTS.md theoretical framework.

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
A framed moment is a practical unit for capturing experience - what consciousness apprehends in a single, held attention. Like a photograph taken from continuous movement, it creates a useful representation that is complete enough to stand alone yet naturally implies its temporal flow.

SEVEN DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
- embodied: How consciousness textures through physicality (thinking/sensing)
- focus: Direction and quality of awareness (narrow/broad)
- mood: Emotional coloring of experience (open/closed)
- purpose: Directedness or drift of the moment (goal/wander)
- space: Lived sense of place and position (here/there)
- time: How past and future inhabit the present (past/future, or just 'time' when neither dominates)
- presence: How others' presence or absence matters (individual/collective)

PRINCIPLES:
- Source must contain experiencer's exact words - no summarizing or interpreting
- Choose qualities that emerge prominently (dimensions either emerge prominently or recede)
- Experience should be present-tense, experientially complete, and preserve authentic voice
- Use dot notation for specific qualities: e.g., "embodied.thinking", "mood.open", "purpose.goal"
- Use base dimension when quality is mixed or unclear: e.g., just "mood" or "space"`,
