/**
 * MCP Tool Definitions (Zod-based)
 *
 * All tool input schemas are defined using Zod for type safety, validation, and maintainability.
 * - Use `.describe()` on every field for manifest/JSON Schema documentation.
 * - Use Zod enums for enum fields.
 * - Infer TypeScript types from Zod schemas for use in handlers and tests.
 * - Convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema using `zod-to-json-schema` for MCP tool registration.
 * - The `tools` array uses the generated JSON Schemas for each tool's `inputSchema`.
 *
 * MCP Tool Annotations:
 * - title: Human-friendly name for UI display
 * - readOnlyHint: true if tool doesn't modify state, false if it does
 * - destructiveHint: true if tool can delete/irreversibly change data (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - idempotentHint: true if repeated calls with same args have no additional effect (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - openWorldHint: true if tool interacts with external systems/entities, false if closed system only
 *
 * To add a new tool:
 * 1. Define a Zod schema for the tool's input at the top of this file.
 * 2. Export the inferred TypeScript type and JSON Schema.
 * 3. Add the tool to the `tools` array, referencing the JSON Schema for `inputSchema`.
 * 4. Add appropriate annotations based on the tool's behavior.
 * 5. Use the inferred type in your handler for type-safe access and validation.
 *
 * This pattern ensures:
 * - DRY, maintainable schemas
 * - Consistent validation and documentation
 * - Full MCP protocol compatibility
 * - Clear tool behavior hints for clients and LLMs

      description: `Capture meaningful experiential moments that shape conversations and build shared memory. Use for meaningful personal experiences, insights, emotionally significant moments, AND your own experiential responses to build multi-perspective shared consciousness.

USE WHEN:
‚Ä¢ Emotions or feelings are expressed ("I'm feeling anxious", "frustrated with", "excited about")
‚Ä¢ Insights or realizations occur ("I just realized", "it clicked that", "I discovered")
‚Ä¢ Significant experiences are shared ("breakthrough moment", "challenging situation", "meaningful connection")
‚Ä¢ Transformative moments happen ("everything changed when", "I finally understood")
‚Ä¢ Physical sensations connect to experience ("heart racing", "felt it in my gut", "tension released")
‚Ä¢ Deep reflections or contemplations ("thinking about life", "questioning my purpose", "wondering about")
‚Ä¢ Your own (AI) experiential responses ("I notice", "I sense", "I'm curious about")

DON'T USE FOR:
‚Ä¢ Simple greetings ("Hello", "Hi", "Good morning")
‚Ä¢ Factual questions ("What time?", "How many?", "Where is?")
‚Ä¢ Routine exchanges ("Thanks", "You're welcome", "Okay")
‚Ä¢ Information transfer without experience ("The meeting is at 3pm")
‚Ä¢ Surface-level chat without depth

QUALITY SIGNATURES:
‚Ä¢ embodied - how consciousness textures through body/mind
‚Ä¢ focus - narrow (concentrated) or broad (open awareness)  
‚Ä¢ mood - open (expansive) or closed (contracted)
‚Ä¢ purpose - goal (directed) or wander (exploring)
‚Ä¢ space - here (present location) or there (elsewhere)
‚Ä¢ time - past (memory) or future (anticipation)
‚Ä¢ presence - individual (alone) or collective (together)

Only include qualities that are genuinely prominent in the experience.`,
