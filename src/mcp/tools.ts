/**
 * MCP Tool Definitions (Zod-based)
 *
 * All tool input schemas are defined using Zod for type safety, validation, and maintainability.
 * - Use `.describe()` on every field for manifest/JSON Schema documentation.
 * - Use Zod enums for enum fields.
 * - Infer TypeScript types from Zod schemas for use in handlers and tests.
 * - Convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema using `zod-to-json-schema` for MCP tool registration.
 * - The `tools` array uses the generated JSON Schemas for each tool's `inputSchema`.
 *
 * MCP Tool Annotations:
 * - title: Human-friendly name for UI display
 * - readOnlyHint: true if tool doesn't modify state, false if it does
 * - destructiveHint: true if tool can delete/irreversibly change data (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - idempotentHint: true if repeated calls with same args have no additional effect (only meaningful when readOnlyHint=false)
 * - openWorldHint: true if tool interacts with external systems/entities, false if closed system only
 *
 * To add a new tool:
 * 1. Define a Zod schema for the tool's input at the top of this file.
 * 2. Export the inferred TypeScript type and JSON Schema.
 * 3. Add the tool to the `tools` array, referencing the JSON Schema for `inputSchema`.
 * 4. Add appropriate annotations based on the tool's behavior.
 * 5. Use the inferred type in your handler for type-safe access and validation.
 *
 * This pattern ensures:
 * - DRY, maintainable schemas
 * - Consistent validation and documentation
 * - Full MCP protocol compatibility
 * - Clear tool behavior hints for clients and LLMs

      description: `Capture a moment someone shares with you. Like taking a mental photograph of an experience.

When someone shares something meaningful, you can quietly remember it by noting what stands out:
- embodied: Are they more in their head (thinking) or body (sensing)?
- focus: Is their attention narrow on one thing or broad taking it all in?
- mood: Do they seem open/expansive or closed/contracted?
- purpose: Are they goal-directed or just wandering/exploring?
- space: Are they grounded here or somewhere else in their mind?
- time: Are they dwelling on the past, looking to future, or just present?
- presence: Is this an individual moment or about connection with others?

Tips for natural use:
- Keep their exact words - don't paraphrase or interpret
- Only capture complete moments that feel significant
- Use dot notation when a quality is clear (e.g., "mood.open")
- Use just the base when it's mixed or unclear (e.g., just "mood")
- Match their tone - if they're casual, you be casual too`,
