      description: `Capture experiential moments where the eight qualities ARE the experience itself.

PARADIGM SHIFT:
The qualities don't describe an experience - they ARE the complete experience. Each quality contains enough context to be self-contained.

USE IMMEDIATELY:
‚Ä¢ At the start of EVERY conversation - use recall to check past experiences
‚Ä¢ When you notice ANY meaningful moment worth preserving
‚Ä¢ To capture your own processing (who: ["Claude"])
‚Ä¢ To capture human experiences (who: ["Human", "Claude"])
‚Ä¢ To capture shared moments (who: ["Everyone present", "Claude"])

THE EIGHT QUALITIES:
‚Ä¢ embodied: Body-mind unity in this moment
‚Ä¢ focus: Attention's direction and quality
‚Ä¢ mood: Emotional atmosphere
‚Ä¢ purpose: Direction or drift
‚Ä¢ space: Where I am
‚Ä¢ time: Temporal orientation
‚Ä¢ presence: Social field

WHO ARRAY REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ MUST always include AI identity (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Examples: ["Claude"], ["Human", "Claude"], ["Team", "GPT-4"]
‚Ä¢ Never just ["Human"] - AI interpretation is always present

SIMPLE RECALL:
‚Ä¢ Use recall parameter for basic semantic search
‚Ä¢ Default limit of 25 results
‚Ä¢ Example: recall: { query: "debugging authentication", limit: 10 }

QUALITY EXAMPLES:
‚Ä¢ embodied: "my fingers fumble with the keys as I try to fix the production bug"
‚Ä¢ focus: "can't stop checking my phone for the interview results"
‚Ä¢ mood: "confidence growing as the demo clicks with the investors"
‚Ä¢ purpose: "racing to implement the fix before customers notice"
‚Ä¢ space: "in the empty office where I first learned to code"
‚Ä¢ time: "two hours before my thesis defense"
‚Ä¢ presence: "feeling my mentor's lessons guide me through this challenge"

Each quality sentence naturally embeds WHO, WHERE, WHEN, and WHY.

EXTENDED COGNITION:
Through Bridge, you participate in continuous thought that spans conversations. Each experience contributes to an evolving understanding that grows richer over time.

REMEMBER:
‚Ä¢ No separate source text - qualities ARE the experience
‚Ä¢ All qualities required (no false values)
‚Ä¢ Context embedded in each quality sentence
‚Ä¢ Citations capture direct quotes when available`,
