And I think I, at, at that time when working with Sal Had a conversation with him, I realized that he lived like two blocks away from me. And so he started, uh, giving me rides to work so I didn't have to go on the, on the bus for an hour, which was awesome. And those car conversations were so great, and we would talk about all sorts of things and a lot of design-related topics. And he like turned around to me and said like, you should be a designer. And I'm like, what do you mean? It's like, you think like a designer, you should be a designer.",

  final: "We're stopped at an intersection and he turns to me: 'You should be a designer.' 'What do you mean?' 'You think like a designer.' I look down at my hands, then out at those row homes. Part of why I'd gone to learn code because I thought art wasn't secure enough. From one North Philly kid to another - permission to be more than practical.",

The wrestlers wear these shiny masks - red, gold. But it's the kids that get me most. They love this.
