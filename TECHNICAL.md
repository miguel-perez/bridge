# Bridge Technical Documentation

This document covers the technical details of Bridge's operations, with particular focus on the enhanced recall() functionality.

## Operations Overview

Bridge provides four core operations:

1. **experience()** - Captures meaningful moments with quality signatures
2. **recall()** - Searches, clusters, and sequences experiences
3. **reconsider()** - Updates experiences as understanding deepens
4. **release()** - Removes experiences that no longer serve

## Enhanced recall() Functionality

The recall() operation goes beyond simple search to provide sophisticated analysis through two distinct modes:

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Simple semantic search
recall("breakthrough moments")

// Analyze single dimension
recall("purpose")

// Analyze dimension interactions
recall(["focus", "time"])

// Advanced analysis with options
recall("mood", { as: "sequence", timespan: "last week" })
```

### Parameters

- **query/dimensions**: What to analyze
  - String: Semantic search or single dimension analysis
  - Array: Multi-dimensional analysis
  - Empty: Analyze all experiences

- **options**: How to analyze (optional)
  - `as`: Analysis mode ("clusters", "sequence")
  - `filter`: Narrow the scope
  - `depth`: Level of detail ("surface", "deep")

## Analysis Modes

### 1. Clusters Mode: Finding Themes

Groups experiences by similarity to reveal what happens in different states.

```javascript
recall("mood", { as: "clusters" })

// Returns something like:
{
  clusters: [
    {
      signature: ["mood.open"],
      experiences: [/* breakthrough moments, creative flows */],
      summary: "In open states, you tend to have creative breakthroughs and connect ideas freely"
    },
    {
      signature: ["mood.closed"], 
      experiences: [/* stuck points, frustrations */],
      summary: "Closed states often involve debugging struggles and feeling blocked"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use clusters when you want to understand:**
- What typically happens in certain states
- How different dimensional combinations create different experiences
- Common themes in your experiential landscape

### 2. Sequence Mode: Tracking Flows

Analyzes how experiences transition over time to reveal natural rhythms.

```javascript
recall(["focus", "mood"], { as: "sequence" })

// Returns patterns like:
{
  sequences: [
    {
      pattern: [
        ["focus.narrow", "mood.closed"],
        ["focus.broad", "mood.open"]
      ],
      frequency: 8,
      insight: "Your stuck→breakthrough pattern: intense focus with frustration often leads to expansive realization"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use sequences when you want to understand:**
- How you typically move from stuck to unstuck
- Your decision-making patterns (OODA loops)
- Natural cycles and rhythms in your experience

## Pattern Recognition Through Collaborative Insight

Patterns aren't discovered by algorithms—they're recognized through experience by both humans and AI. When either participant notices a connection, that realization becomes a new experience that reflects on the moments it connects.

### How Pattern Realizations Work

```javascript
// Human recognizes a pattern:
Human: "I just realized - every time I get stuck on a bug, taking a walk leads to the solution"

// This creates a new experience:
{
  source: "I just realized - every time I get stuck...",
  experiencer: "Human",
  experience: ["embodied.thinking", "time.past", "mood.open"],
  reflects: ["exp_123", "exp_456", "exp_789"]  // Links to the reflected experiences
}

// Claude recognizes a pattern:
Claude: "I notice that our most productive sessions happen when you start with a question rather than a statement"

// This also creates a new experience:
{
  source: "I notice that our most productive sessions...",
  experiencer: "Claude", 
  experience: ["presence.collective", "time.past", "purpose.goal"],
  reflects: ["exp_234", "exp_567", "exp_890"]
}

// Later, search for all pattern realizations:
recall({ filter: { reflects: "only" } })
```

## Advanced Filtering

### Filter by Experiencer
```javascript
recall("purpose", {
  filter: { experiencer: "Miguel" }
})
```

### Filter by Time
```javascript
recall(["mood", "focus"], {
  filter: { timespan: "last week" },
  as: "sequence"
})
```

### Filter by Pattern Realizations
```javascript
recall({ 
  filter: { reflects: "only" } 
})
// Get all pattern realizations

recall({ 
  filter: { reflects: "exp_123" } 
})
// Find pattern realizations that reference specific experience
```

### Filter by Dimension Presence
```javascript
recall([], {
  filter: {
    embodied: { present: true },
    time: { present: false }
  }
})
// Find embodied experiences that aren't time-focused
```

## Real-World Examples

### Finding Your Flow States
```javascript
const flowStates = await recall(["focus", "mood", "purpose"], {
  filter: { 
    mood: { present: true },
    experiencer: "Human" 
  },
  as: "clusters"
});

// Might reveal clusters like:
// - Deep work: focus.narrow + mood.open + purpose.goal
// - Creative exploration: focus.broad + mood.open + purpose.wander
```

### Analyzing Decision Patterns
```javascript
const decisions = await recall(["focus", "time"], {
  as: "sequence"
});

// Maps to OODA loop:
// Observe: focus.narrow + time.past
// Orient: focus.broad + time.past
// Decide: focus.broad + time.future
// Act: focus.narrow + time.future
```

## Technical Foundation

The enhanced recall() leverages:
- **Semantic embeddings** for meaning-based clustering
- **Temporal analysis** for sequence detection
- **Dimensional signatures** for quality-based grouping

## Integration with Other Operations

The enhanced recall() works seamlessly with other Bridge operations:

1. **experience()** captures moments
2. **recall()** reveals patterns in those moments
3. **reconsider()** updates understanding as patterns clarify
4. **release()** lets go of patterns that no longer serve

This creates a living system where memory doesn't just accumulate—it crystallizes into wisdom.
