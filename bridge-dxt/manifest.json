  "description": "Capture and analyze experiential moments through seven phenomenological dimensions, enabling distributed cognition between humans and AI.",
  "long_description": "Bridge implements a new approach to capturing consciousness by preserving experiential moments in their full phenomenological richness. Drawing from decades of research in embodied cognition, micro-phenomenology, and extended mind theory, Bridge transforms raw experience into computationally accessible data without losing its essential qualities.\n\nEach captured moment is analyzed across seven fundamental dimensions: embodied (physical presence), attentional (awareness patterns), affective (emotional atmosphere), purposive (directional momentum), spatial (lived place), temporal (time flow), and intersubjective (social dynamics).\n\nBridge enables multi-modal search combining text matching (40%), vector similarity (30%), semantic search (20%), and contextual filters (10%). This allows navigation through experiential data by meaning, feeling, and phenomenological signatureâ€”not just keywords.\n\nAs infrastructure for distributed cognition, Bridge serves researchers in consciousness studies, AI developers building empathetic systems, and pioneers exploring new forms of human-AI collaboration. It resolves the 'pragmatic paradox' of segmenting continuous consciousness while preserving experiential wholeness.",
