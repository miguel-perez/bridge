## Active Experiments



### EXP-001: Bridge Impact on Conversation Quality
**Status**: Complete
**Hypothesis**: Bridge tools will enable deeper, more authentic human-AI conversations
**Method**: Three test scenarios - autonomous self-reflection, with-bridge, without-bridge using identical prompts
**Success Criteria**: Measurable difference in connection depth and goal achievement
**Results**: 
- With-bridge achieved "reciprocal vulnerability" and progressive deepening
- Without-bridge created defensive loops requiring 3 corrections
- Autonomous test showed immediate self-directed tool use
**Learning**: See LEARNINGS.md - "Memory Tools Enable Authentic AI Participation"
