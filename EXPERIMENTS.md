### EXP-010: Advanced Recall Options with Intuitive Time-based Filtering

**Status**: Active 2025-07-22  
**Purpose**: Enable full recall options with sorting, pagination, and natural language time filtering to scale with growing experiential databases

**Problem Space Themes Addressed**:

- **Database Scaling**: Growing experiential databases need efficient result control
- **User Experience**: Current recall returns all matches without presentation options
- **Temporal Reflection**: Natural language time expressions are fundamental to human reflection

- Implement pagination: `limit: number, offset: number`
- Add result metadata: total count, hasMore, etc.
- Performance optimization at database level
- **Goal**: Basic recall control and performance improvement

**Phase 2: Natural Language Time Filtering (Week 2) - 15% Impact, 30% Effort**

- Integrate date parsing library (date-fns or chrono-node)
- Support natural expressions: "this month", "last week", "yesterday"
- Maintain backward compatibility with explicit date ranges
- **Goal**: Intuitive temporal queries for human reflection

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3) - 5% Impact, 50% Effort**

- Result formatting options
- Advanced filtering combinations
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- **Goal**: Polish and advanced query capabilities

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Sorting Options**: Test recall with different sort parameters
2. **Pagination Control**: Test limit and offset functionality
3. **Result Metadata**: Verify total count and hasMore indicators
