# Bridge Experiments

**Document Purpose**: This tracks active and completed experiments on Bridge functionality. Each experiment is designed
to test specific features and generate learnings through the learning loop. For insights from completed experiments, see
LEARNINGS.md.

**For Developers**: Use this to understand what's being tested and contribute new experiments.

This document outlines experiments designed to work with our learning loop. Each experiment includes specific test
scenarios that allow Opus to evaluate results and suggest improvements.

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment follows this format for learning loop compatibility:
1. **Test Scenarios**: Specific conversation flows to test
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: What Opus should evaluate
3. **Learning Questions**: What insights we seek
4. **Evidence Trail**: Links to test results and learnings

## Completed Experiments

**Technical Implementation**: Added clustering service, enhanced recall handler, implemented dimensional and semantic clustering

**Evidence**: Integration tests passing, learning loop analysis complete, commit e468d67

## Completed Experiments

### EXP-005: Pattern Realizations with reflects Field
**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21  
**Purpose**: Implement `reflects` field to enable capturing pattern realizations as linkable experiences

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ All success criteria met
- Pattern realizations can be created and stored successfully
- All reflect-based search queries work correctly (`reflects: "only"`, `reflected_by`)
- 100% backward compatibility with existing experiences
- Performance impact minimal (<10% increase in recall latency)

**Technical Implementation**: Added `reflects?: string[]` field to Source interface, implemented bidirectional filtering, enhanced tool descriptions

**Evidence**: 507 unit tests passing, schema validation successful, learning loop analysis complete
