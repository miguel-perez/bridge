# Bridge Experiments

This document outlines experiments designed to work with our learning loop. Each experiment includes specific test scenarios that allow Opus to evaluate results and suggest improvements.

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment follows this format for learning loop compatibility:
1. **Test Scenarios**: Specific conversation flows to test
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: What Opus should evaluate
3. **Learning Questions**: What insights we see
