### EXP-013: Minimal Flow Tracking (Still Thinking)

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-24  
**Started**: 2025-07-24  
**Purpose**: Implement minimal flow tracking inspired by sequential thinking pattern, providing "permission to continue" signals without complex orchestration

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ All success criteria met

- Successfully implemented `stillThinking` boolean parameter across all tools
- Session-scoped call counter (no persistence needed)
- Explicit flow state messages for user acknowledgment
- Maintained complete tool independence
- 100% backward compatibility

**Evidence of Success**:

- **Implementation**: ~10 lines of code vs 200+ lines of complex orchestration
- **Test Coverage**: All 663 unit tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: New `still-thinking-flow` scenario working correctly
- **User Feedback**: Explicit acknowledgment messages added based on request
- **Performance**: Negligible overhead - simple counter and message generation

**Learning**: Minimal patterns can provide 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity. The stillThinking parameter successfully provides flow awareness without sacrificing tool independence or adding complex state management.

**Enhancement (2025-07-24)**: Updated flow messages to return three separate responses for improved UX - main response + status message + permission/conclusion message.

### EXP-012: Bridge Sequential Thinking (Replaced by EXP-013)

**Status**: Replaced 2025-07-24  
**Started**: 2025-07-23  
**Purpose**: Test Bridge.flow() as a new MCP tool that orchestrates existing Bridge operations into learning loops, replacing sequential thinking with experiential problem-solving through iterative understanding evolution.

**Key Outcomes**: ✅ All success criteria met

- Successfully demonstrated understanding evolution from vague to specific
- Seamless orchestration of existing Bridge tools (experience, recall, reconsider, release)
- Flow state persistence across conversation turns
- Natural progression through iteration without complex revision logic
- Complete visibility into learning journey with moment tracking

**Evidence of Success**:

- **Integration Test**: `bridge-flow-orchestration` scenario completed successfully (14 turns, 19 tool calls)
- **Understanding Evolution**: "Debug auth error" → "Debug auth timezone issue" → "Implement UTC timestamp normalization"
- **Tool Orchestration**: Flow service correctly orchestrates all Bridge tools
- **State Management**: Flow state maintained across multiple calls with understanding history
- **Unit Tests**: All flow service unit tests passing (11/11)

**Learning**: Bridge.flow() successfully provided a more natural and experiential approach to problem-solving by orchestrating existing Bridge tools into learning loops where understanding evolves through iteration. However, this approach was replaced by the simpler stillThinking parameter (EXP-013) which achieved similar flow awareness with 95% less complexity.

### EXP-011: Comprehensive Quality Detection with Natural Language

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-22  
**Purpose**: Test comprehensive quality detection using natural language across all combinations to validate Bridge's quality detection system

- Tests specific subtypes (embodied.thinking, focus.narrow, mood.open, etc.)
- Tests mixed patterns and edge cases
- Includes quality validation queries for sophisticated filtering
- Uses natural language prompts requiring AI interpretation

**Quality Detection Validation**:

- **Single Types**: Correctly uses base types when subtypes don't fit
- **Specific Subtypes**: Correctly uses subtypes when obvious
- **Mixed Patterns**: Captures multiple dimensions simultaneously
- **Natural Language**: AI correctly interprets experiential descriptions
- **Philosophical Consistency**: Maintains Bridge's experiential framework

**Example Successful Detections**:

- `"I feel my body"` → `embodied.sensing` ✅
- `"My attention is scattered"` → `focus.broad, embodied.thinking` ✅
- `"I am thinking deeply about this problem"` → `embodied.thinking, focus.narrow, purpose.goal` ✅
- `"I am present"` → `presence.individual, embodied.sensing, space.here, time` ✅

**Evidence**: Test results show successful quality detection across 16 turns before API rate limits, commit 4e2720c

**Learning**: Natural language prompts provide robust validation of Bridge's quality detection system without bias, ensuring the AI correctly interprets experiential descriptions according to philosophical principles.
