### EXP-005: Pattern Realizations with reflects Field

**Purpose**: Implement and test the `reflects` field to enable capturing pattern realizations as linkable experiences that connect insights across multiple experiences

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21

**Hypothesis**: Adding a `reflects: string[]` field to the SourceRecord type will enable both humans and AI to capture "aha" moments about connections between experiences, creating a foundation for collaborative wisdom building. This will allow Bridge to distinguish between regular experiences and meta-experiences that reflect on patterns.

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Data Model Extension** 
   - Add `reflects?: string[]` field to SourceRecord interface
   - Update Zod schemas to validate the new field
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing experiences
   - Test storage and retrieval of experiences with reflects field

2. **Pattern Realization Creation**
   - Human creates pattern realization: "I notice I always feel anxious before things that end up going well"
   - AI creates pattern realization: "I see a pattern where your mood.closed experiences often precede mood.open breakthroughs"
   - Both types link to specific experience IDs via reflects field
   - Verify pattern realizations are stored as experiences with reflects field

3. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**
   - Query for all pattern realizations: `recall("", { filter: { reflects: "only" } })`
   - Find experiences reflected by specific insight: `recall("", { filter: { reflected_by: "exp-789" } })`
   - Find insights that reflect on specific experiences: `recall("", { filter: { reflects: ["exp-123"] } })`
   - Mixed queries: `recall("anxiety patterns", { filter: { reflects: "only" } })`

4. **Collaborative Wisdom Building**
   - Human creates initial pattern realization
   - AI builds on human insight with additional connections
   - Human refines AI's pattern realization through reconsider
   - Both participants can query and build on shared insights

5. **Pattern Recognition Workflow**
   - Capture baseline experiences (anxiety, success, etc.)
   - Create pattern realization linking multiple experiences
   - Query for related patterns and insights
   - Demonstrate bidirectional linking (what reflects on what)

**Measurable Outcomes**:

- **Data Model Success**: 100% backward compatibility with existing experiences
- **Pattern Creation**: Both human and AI can successfully create pattern realizations
- **Search Functionality**: All reflect-based queries return appropriate results
- **Linking Accuracy**: Bidirectional linking works correctly (reflects/reflected_by)
- **Performance Impact**: <10% increase in recall operation latency
- **Schema Validation**: All new experiences with reflects field pass validation
- **Storage Integrity**: Pattern realizations persist correctly across sessions

**Learning Questions**:

1. **Data Model Design**: Does the `reflects: string[]` field effectively capture the relationship between pattern realizations and source experiences?

2. **Search Usability**: Are the new filter options intuitive and powerful enough for discovering pattern insights?

3. **Collaborative Dynamics**: How do human and AI pattern realizations complement each other in building shared wisdom?

4. **Performance Impact**: Does the reflects field significantly impact search performance or storage requirements?

5. **Pattern Recognition Quality**: Do the captured pattern realizations provide genuine insights that enhance understanding?

6. **Workflow Integration**: How naturally does pattern realization creation fit into existing Bridge workflows?

### EXP-004: Strategic Test Coverage Improvement

**Purpose**: Systematically improve test coverage from 26% to 60%+ to reduce bug introduction rate

**Status**: Completed 2025-07-21

**Hypothesis**: The high bug fix rate (33% of commits) is directly correlated with low test coverage (26%). By
strategically improving coverage in high-traffic, high-risk areas, we can reduce future bug introduction and improve
development velocity.
