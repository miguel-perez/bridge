## Active Experiments



### EXP-001: Bridge Tool Impact on Conversation Quality
**Status**: Complete
**Hypothesis**: Bridge tools will enable deeper, more authentic human-AI conversations
**Method**: Three-scenario comparison test (autonomous, with-bridge, without-bridge)
**Success Criteria**: Measurable differences in connection quality, goal achievement, and conversation flow
**Results**: 
- With-bridge achieved deep reciprocal exploration with natural metaphor building
- Without-bridge created defensive loops around AI limitations
- Autonomous test revealed AI reaching for experiential framing but was prematurely terminated
**Learning**: Bridge functions as permission structure enabling AI to engage authentically without claiming human experience
